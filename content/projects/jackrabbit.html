<p>Jackrabbit has graduated incubation. For more information,
      please see the

<div class="section-content">
<p>The Jackrabbit podling has been formed to develop an open
      source implementation of the Content Repository for Java
      Technology API (JCR), as specified within the Java Community
      Process as 
      <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR 170</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR 283</a>. 
      <a href="http://www.day.com/">Day Software</a>, the JCR
      specification lead, has licensed an initial implementation of
      the JCR reference implementation for use as seed code for
      this project. JCR specifies an API for application developers
      (and application frameworks) to use for interaction with
      modern content repositories -- content management systems
      that provide content services such as versioning,
      transactions, indexing, workflow, etc.</p>
<p>Jackrabbit's implementation began as a proposal within the
      
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/index.html">Jakarta
      Slide</a> project, but has since attracted interest from
      multiple projects with the 
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>,
      including Slide, Cocoon, Lenya, Graffito, XML
      Indexing, and Derby. We are also looking at integration with
      projects such as Maven and Beehive.</p>
<p>The purpose of this incubation period is to attract
      additional contributors from other Apache projects and from
      the various JSR 170 and 283 expert group companies, learn the
      Apache way of doing things, and allow the developers to focus
      on this interface/implementation rather than all of the
      existing projects that might want to use it. We hope to
      improve collaboration on the code base by moving all of the
      active developers and authors to Apache, bring in as many of
      the Apache veterans as wish to get involved, and open it up
      to all of the 22 expert group companies. Development of the
      JCR RI and TCK will occur in this project -- Day Software
      plans to continue participation in Jackrabbit and use the
      code in the official RI and TCK releases, allowing developers
      to beta test against the open source versions as well as the
      official versions.</p>

<p>Jackrabbit accomplished its first official incubating
        release with version 0.9 of the Apache Jackrabbit reference
        implementation and JCR-RMI tools. Day Software has
        confirmed that the version 0.9 jars have passed the JCR 1.0
        TCK with the current exclude list.</p>
<p>We are now getting reorganized for graduation from the
        Incubator to our own top-level project at the Apache
        Software Foundation. The Jackrabbit committers voted on
        March 11, 2006, to request graduation. In addition, we made
        a call to refresh the list of active committers for an
        accurate presentation to the board; Stefano Mazzocchi,
        Gianugo Rabellino, Paul Russell, Tim Reilly, and Andrew
        Savory have requested emeritus status, meaning that they
        won't be listed on the initial project management committee
        but are welcome to come back if they choose to rejoin the
        project at a later time.</p>

          <li>Brian Moseley</li>
          <li>Angela Schreiber</li>
        </ul>
<p>in recognition of their outstanding and sustained
        contributions to the project. Jukka Zitting has volunteered
        to be the RM for our first set of incubating releases. We
        plan to seek graduation from incubator as soon as we have a

<p>The Apache Jackrabbit podling is slowly recovering from
        the impact of finalizing JSR 170, initializing JSR 283 (the
        next JCR specification revision EG), and the summer holiday
        schedule. We are in the process of reconfiguring our source
        directories for an eventual 1.0 release and Maven 2
        support. No new committers were added this quarter, though
        we expect more to be added soon.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='Status20050715'>2005/07/15</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Jackrabbit has attracted public interest from many
        different projects, both open source and commercial in
        nature, and has over 250 people reading the developer list.
        During the past quarter we added one new committer, Edgar
        Poce, and cleared the minimum threshold of three
        independent committers.</p>
<p>The big news is that JCR, the Content Repository for
        Java Technology 1.0 API, has been completed by the JSR 170
        expert group and received final approval from the J2SE/EE
        executive committee at the end of May. We are currently
        working on restructuring the Jackrabbit project directories
        in preparation of an eagerly anticipated first release
        candidate and passing the official TCK, at which point we
        are hoping to graduate from Incubator to TLP status for the
        1.0 release.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='Status20050425'>2005/04/25</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Jackrabbit is doing well as a project and is attracting
        interest both within other Apache projects (Lenya and
        Graffito in particular) as well as from new folks in the
        Java community. We added two new committers, Jukka Zitting
        and Dominique Pfister, and have received sustained
        contributions from Serge Huber, Edgar Poce, Angela
        Schreiber, Felix Meschberger, and others.</p>
<p>Jackrabbit's only problem right now is continued
        reliance on JCP EG private discussions due to the
        unfinished nature of the JSR 170 Content Repository for
        Java Technology API. JSR 170 is expected to be submitted
        for final draft status in early May, after which all of the
        discussion can be moved to Apache lists. We anticipate
        graduating from Incubator sometime soon after that.</p>

<p>The Jackrabbit project has completed all of the

<p>with a few link bugs due to the svn/viewcvs integration.
        Our big task from now to graduation is to get the community
        more involved in development, planning features,
        integrating with some of the DB projects, and scoping out
        interesting applications to build on top of the
