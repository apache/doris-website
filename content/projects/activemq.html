<p>The full status of incubation is here. In summary we're most of the way through incubation now, things have been progressing very well; the code is clean and using only Apache-compliant libraries, it has the correct copyright notices and is in the org.apache.activemq namespace and is generally working well now. We've got the software grants sorted and most developers have their CLAs on file and accounts created (we've a few more to do once we know the CLAs are on file).</p>
<p>We've voted on a milestone release which should go out soon once we've figured out the practicalities of doing an incuabtor milestone release. Our main outstanding issue now is creating the full website at Apache - which should be done in the next week or two - for now there is a simple home page.</p>

<p>The STATUS file for the project is up to date. The code is clean and using only Apache-compliant libraries, it has the correct copyright notices and is in the org.apache.activemq namespace. We've got all the software grants sorted and all developers have their CLAs on file and accounts created. The project's active mailing lists are proof of the vibrant community behind ActiveMQ. Nathan Mittler was voted in as committer due to his excellent work on the C++ client for ActiveMQ.</p>
<p>The Java code base has has being going through QA and stabilization for the past few months and several release candidates for 4.0 have been cut. The 4.0 final release is currently under Vote and we expect to have a final release very shortly. Development is starting to gear up now for the 4.1 release and we are excited to find out where the community and committers drive the development of the next 4.1 release.</p>
<p>The website home page has now been sorted out and is being checked into svn. The static HTML is being generated from a Confluence wiki and content is very easy to update now. See: http://incubator.apache.org/activemq/</p>

<p>The ActiveMQ community continues to grow as evidenced by the mailing list volumes. Each month mailing list volumes continues to grow. Last month we had 574 emails sent to the developer list and 905 email sent to the user list! We have also seen a big increase in the amount of patches and contributions submitted from non ActiveMQ committers.</p>
<p>A large amount of development work and community interest has been around the Native clients used to access the Messaging broker. Tim Bish's excellent work on the STOMP c++ client has earned him an invitation to become an ActiveMQ committer. Amazon did a in house c++ client to ActiveMQ and that source code donation was accepted and committed to the source tree.</p>
<p>All the source headers in the 2 active branches have be update to comply with the new policies outline at: [WWW] http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html.</p>
<p>The Apache ActiveMQ 4.0.1 has successfully been released. For more information about the release, see: [WWW] http://incubator.apache.org/activemq/activemq-401-release.html Development continues on the next 4.1 release. In tandem, the 4.0 branch has continued to stabilize and a 4.0.2 release should be ready shortly.</p>
<p>The project has discussed graduating and feels that ActiveMQ is ready and would prefer to become a TLP. Once the 4.0.2 release is completed expect more serious discussions regarding graduation to pop up on the incubator mailing lists.</p>
