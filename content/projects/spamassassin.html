have vetted the CLA coverage of the current codebase. Mostly, the
ball is in the ASF's court ;) Have received agreement from current
domain holder of &quot;spamassassin.org&quot; that it will be transferred to
the ASF. * plans and expectations for the next period? Hopefully
we'll get the TM assignment taken care of, and the CLAs vetted; then
we'll be ready (at least in terms of ASF procedures) to issue a 3.0.0

<div class="source"><code>* is the STATUS file up to date? (also post link)
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/incubator/site/projects/s
amassass in.cwiki Not quite -- the two 'Establish a list of active
committers' items are not up to date. All active committers are now
signed up, so that can be closed off. The second item is 'Add all
active committers in the STATUS file.' However, I'm now confused.
Which is the canonical STATUS file --
/incubator/spamassassin/trunk/STATUS, or
/incubator/site/projects/spamassassin.cwiki? Some signs seem to be
pointing to the latter... so, if the latter, some cut and paste from
the former to the latter is then required (and note, I don't think I
or anyone else on the SpamAssassin PPMC have write access to it). I'm
kind of taking the approach that the latter is the incubation
checklist, and the former is tracking our assets and people. That may
be wrong though BTW the former is here:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/spamassassin/trunk/STATUS
Also, the two tasks under 'Verify distribution rights', should be
complete. All code in the trunk is covered by CLAs, and the
non-covered branches have README files noting their non-Apache status
and presence for historical purposes only. However, perhaps this may
need to be verified by the ASF before the task can be marked as
complete, I'm not sure. * any legal, cross-project or personal issues
that still need to be addressed? Copyright and distribution rights
still remain to be verified, although all CLAs should now be in. --
so it's up to ASF legal now. The trademark issue on the
&quot;SpamAssassin&quot; name is still in progress; as far as I know, NAI legal
still need to provide some documentation to DW, Jim Jagielski et al.
* what has been done for incubation since the last report? Lots! - -
all committer accounts are set up; - - source code is now running
from the Apache Incubator SVN repository; - - all of the
developer-oriented mailing lists are now at the Incubator - although
some user-oriented lists are still external, to avoid user confusion;
- - all code has been vetted for CLA coverage, and removed or
clean-roomed if a CLA could not be provided, and this is now awaiting
verification by the ASF; - - and all major code or rules files in SVN
are tagged with the ASL 1.1. - - The Wiki has been moved to
wiki.apache.org. * plans and expectations for the next period? We
need to transition more infrastructure, including our main website,
Wiki and Bugzilla. Bugzilla uses some custom code to track CLAs,
which would be nice to bring over. We also plan to finish up the
legal situation, by getting the CLA coverage verified by the ASF,
then the trademark. Also we have several cron scripts that are used
to perform distributed rule QA, and a very large rsync server contain
2.7Gb of data, which will need to be migrated. What to do with these
is still a topic of discussion, since they're *big* in terms of disk
space usage, and there may not be room at the ASF infrastructure for
this! There's also a spamtrap server which almost definitely should
*not* come along -- it handles approx 1 Gbit of traffic per day (in
spam reports) and would be a waste of ASF hardware and bandwidth,
IMO. * any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you? A little more introductory doco would be nice; I hadn't
heard of http://www.apache.org/dev/ until quite late in the process,
and there were a few other issues where I had to hop around the
apache.org website to figure out what things meant or what a given
procedure was. Also, one thing I'm concerned about is how many
aspects of our infrastructure will wind up with &quot;incubator&quot; in their
URL or hostname; as a mature project, it'd be much easier to
transition with the minimum of changes for the existing community,
and this scoping of URLs and hostnames as in incubation means an
additional change once we leave the incubator. As a result, it gives
us a bit of an incentive to *not* set things up (lists, etc.) until
we leave.

<div class="source"><code>The moving to the ASF infrastructure is partly delayed by the limited
resources available in the ASF Infrastructure team (time). Also, this
mature project has quite a lot of infrastructure to move. I suggest
we don't let this be one of the points to keep SA in the Incubator;
the intent to move to the ASF infrastructure is there.
