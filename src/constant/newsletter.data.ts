        content: `Doris 3.1 introduces a sparse column and schema template for the VARIANT data type, making it more efficient to store and query large datasets with dynamic fields, such as logs and JSON data. For lakehouse capabilities, it enhances asynchronous materialized views and expands support for Iceberg and Paimon to build a stronger bridge between data lakes and data warehouses.`,

        content: `At the core of database systems, the query optimizer acts as a shrewd strategist, constantly analyzing data traits to devise the optimal execution plans. Apache Doris, a high-performance MPP analytical database, employs a built-in Data Trait analysis mechanism in its optimizer. By uncovering statistical traits and semantic constraints within the data, Data Trait provides fundamental support for query optimization. Letâ€™s explore its power!`,
