## Description

Reserved keywords are words that have special meanings in SQL. Reserved keywords are a special category of keywords; if you want to use them as object identifiers, you must use backticks (`). For example, ```FROM```. For more details on object identifiers, please refer to the [Object Identifiers](../basic-element/object-identifiers) section.
