## Description

Calculates the cosine distance between two vectors (vector values are coordinates)

## Syntax

```sql
COSINE_DISTANCE(<array1>, <array2>)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<array1>` | The first vector (the vector value is the coordinate). The subtypes of the input array are: TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, LARGEINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE. The number of elements must be consistent with array2 |
| `<array2>` | The second vector (the vector value is the coordinate), the subtype of the input array supports: TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, LARGEINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, the number of elements must be consistent with array1 |

## Return Value

Returns the cosine distance between two vectors (where the vector values are coordinates). If the input array is NULL, or any element in the array is NULL, then NULL is returned.

## Example

```sql
SELECT COSINE_DISTANCE([1, 2], [2, 3]),COSINE_DISTANCE([3, 6], [4, 7]);
```
