## floor

### description
#### Syntax

`T floor(T x[, d])`

If not specified `d`: returns the largest integer value less than or equal to `x`, which is **the most common usage**.
Otherwise, returns the largest round number that is less than or equal to `x` and flowing the rules:

If `d` is specified as literal:  
`d` = 0: just like without `d`
`d` > 0 or `d` < 0: the round number would be a multiple of `1/(10^d)`, or the nearest number of the appropriate data type if `1/(10^d)` isn't exact.

Else if `d` is a column, and `x` has Decimal type, scale of result Decimal will always be same with input Decimal.

:::tip
Another alias for this function is `dfloor`.
