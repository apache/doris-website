**1. `{ COLUMN | MATERIALIZED VIEW | ROLLUP }`**
>Specify the type of modification to be canceled, one of which must be selected
>- `COLUMN`: Cancel the modification operation on the table column
>- `ROLLUP`: Cancel the modification operation on the view
>- `MATERIALIZED VIEW`: Cancel the modification operation on the materialized view
