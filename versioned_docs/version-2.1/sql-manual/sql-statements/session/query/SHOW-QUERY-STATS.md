## Description

This statement is used to display the database table columns hit by the historical query

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW QUERY STATS [ { [FOR <db_name>] | [FROM <table_name>] } ] [ALL] [VERBOSE]];
```

## Optional Parameters

**1. `<db_name>`**

> If this parameter is set, the matching information of the database is displayed

**2. `<table_name>`**

> If this parameter is set, the matching status of a table is queried

**3. `ALL`**

> ALL Specifies whether to display the matching information of all indexes

**4. `VERBOSE`**

> VERBOSE displays detailed matching information

## Access Control Requirements

The user who executes this SQL command must have at least the following permissions:

| Privilege          | Object    | Notes              |
|:-------------------|:----------|:-------------------|
| SELECT_PRIV        | DATABASE  | You must have the SELECT permission on the queried database |

## Usage Notes

- Query the historical query matching status of databases and tables. Data is reset after fe is restarted, and statistics are collected for each fe.

- You can use FOR DATABASE and FROM TABLE to specify the matching information of the database or table to be queried, followed by the database name or table name.

- The ALL and VERBOSE parameters can be used alone or together, but they must be used last and only for table queries.

- If no databases are being used, then simply executing 'SHOW QUERY STATS' will show the hits of all databases.

- There may be two columns in the hit result: QueryCount indicates the number of times the column has been queried, and FilterCount indicates the number of times the column has been queried as the where condition.

## Examples

```sql
show query stats from baseall
```
