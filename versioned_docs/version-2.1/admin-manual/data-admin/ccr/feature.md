The Cross-Cluster Replication (CCR) feature in Doris is primarily used for efficiently synchronizing data between multiple clusters, thereby enhancing business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities. CCR supports various operations in Doris, ensuring data consistency across different clusters. Below are the details of the main Doris operations supported by CCR.

:::note

1. The `-` in Doris Version indicates Doris version 2.0 and above, all versions of CCR. It is recommended to use Doris version 2.0.15 or 2.1.6 or later.
2. Version requirements for CCR Syncer and Doris: Syncer Version >= Downstream Doris Version >= Upstream Doris Version. Therefore, upgrade Syncer first, then the downstream Doris, and finally the upstream Doris.
3. CCR currently does not support the separation of storage and computation.

## Database

### Database Properties

Database-level jobs will synchronize the properties of the database during Full Sync.

| Property                | Supported | Doris Version | Sync Method | Description |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| replication_allocation  | Supported | -             | Full Sync   |             |
| data quota              | Not Supported |           |             |             |
| replica quota           | Not Supported |           |             |             |

### Modify Database Properties

CCR jobs do not synchronize operations that modify database properties.

| Property                | Supported | Can Upstream Operate | Can Downstream Operate | Description                              |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| replication_allocation  | Not Supported | No                 | No                     | Operations on both sides will cause CCR jobs to be interrupted |
| data quota              | Not Supported | Yes                | Yes                    |                                          |
| replica quota           | Not Supported | Yes                | Yes                    |                                          |

### Rename Database

Renaming is not supported for upstream and downstream; if done, it may cause views to stop working.

### Basic Table Operations

| Operation      | Supported | Doris Version | Sync Method | Can Downstream Operate Independently | Description |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| create table   | Supported | -             | SQL/Partial Sync | Cannot operate on tables synchronized by CCR jobs. | Refer to the properties for creating tables; in most cases, use SQL for synchronization; for some operations, such as when users set certain session variables or when the create table statement includes inverted indexes, use partial sync |
| drop table     | Supported | -             | SQL/Full Sync | Same as above | Before 2.0.15/2.1.6: Full Sync, after: SQL |
| rename table   | Table-level jobs do not support database-level jobs | 2.1.8/3.0.4 | SQL | Same as above | Table-level job renames will cause CCR jobs to stop |
| replace table  | Supported | 2.1.8/3.0.4 | SQL/Full Sync | Same as above | Use SQL for database-level synchronization; table-level triggers full synchronization |
| truncate table | Supported | -             | SQL | Same as above | |
| restore table  | Not Supported | | | Same as above | |

### Modify Table Properties

The synchronization method is SQL.
