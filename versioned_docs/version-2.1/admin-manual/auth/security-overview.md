Doris provides the following mechanisms to manage data security:

**Authentication:** Doris supports both username/password and LDAP authentication methods.

- **Built-in Authentication:** Doris includes a built-in username/password authentication method, allowing customization of password policies.

- **LDAP Authentication:** Doris can centrally manage user credentials through LDAP services, simplifying access control and enhancing system security.

**Permission Management:** Doris supports role-based access control (RBAC) or can inherit Ranger to achieve centralized permission management.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Doris can restrict users' access to and operations on database resources based on their roles and permissions.

- **Ranger Permission Management:** By integrating with Ranger, Doris enables centralized permission management, allowing administrators to set fine-grained access control policies for different users and groups.

**Audit and Logging:** Doris can enable audit logs to record all user actions, including logins, queries, data modifications, and more, facilitating post-audit and issue tracking.

**Data Encryption and Masking:** Doris supports encryption and masking of data within tables to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage.

**Data Transmission Encryption:** Doris supports SSL encryption protocols to ensure secure data transmission between clients and Doris servers, preventing data from being intercepted or tampered with during transfer.

**Fine-Grained Access Control:** Doris allows configuring data row and column access permissions based on rules to control user access at a granular level.
