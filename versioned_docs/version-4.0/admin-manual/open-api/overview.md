As a supplement to Apache Doris operation and maintenance management, OPEN API is mainly used by database administrators to perform some management operations.

:::note
The OPEN API is currently unstable and is only recommended for developers to test and use. We may change the interface behavior in subsequent versions.
In a production environment, it is recommended to use SQL commands to complete operations.
