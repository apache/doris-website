## Description

The YEARWEEK function is used to return the "year + week number" combination for a specified date (format YYYYWW, e.g., 202301 represents week 1 of 2023). This function flexibly defines the start day of the week and the criteria for determining the "first week" through the optional parameter mode, defaulting to mode=0.

Week numbers range from 1-53, depending on the mode configuration.

The effect of parameter mode is shown in the table below:

|Mode |First day of week |Week number range |Definition of first week                              |
|:----|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
|0    |Sunday            |1-53              |The week containing the first Sunday of the year     |
|1    |Monday            |1-53              |The first week with 4 or more days in the year      |
|2    |Sunday            |1-53              |The week containing the first Sunday of the year     |
|3    |Monday            |1-53              |The first week with 4 or more days in the year      |
|4    |Sunday            |1-53              |The first week with 4 or more days in the year      |
|5    |Monday            |1-53              |The week containing the first Monday of the year     |
|6    |Sunday            |1-53              |The first week with 4 or more days in the year      |
|7    |Monday            |1-53              |The week containing the first Monday of the year     |

This function is consistent with the [yearweek function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_yearweek) in MySQL.

## Syntax

```sql
YEARWEEK(`<date_or_time_expr>`[, mode])
```

## Return Value

Returns an INT type integer in YYYYWW format (first 4 digits are the year, last 2 digits are the week number), e.g., 202305 represents week 5 of 2023, 202052 represents week 52 of 2020.

- If the week containing the date belongs to the previous year, returns the previous year's year and week number (e.g., January 1, 2021 might return 202052).
- If the week containing the date belongs to the next year, returns the next year's year and week 1 (e.g., December 30, 2024 might return 202501).
- If input is NULL, returns NULL.

## Examples

```sql
-- Default mode=0 (Sunday start, first week contains first Sunday)
-- 2021-01-01 is Friday, the first Sunday of the week is 2020-12-27, so it belongs to week 52 of 2020
SELECT YEARWEEK('2021-01-01') AS yearweek_mode0;
+----------------+
| yearweek_mode0 |
+----------------+
|         202052 |
+----------------+

-- mode=1 (Monday start, 4-day rule, consistent with WEEKOFYEAR)
SELECT YEARWEEK('2020-07-01', 1) AS yearweek_mode1;
+----------------+
| yearweek_mode1 |
+----------------+
|         202027 |
+----------------+

-- mode=1, cross-year week (2024-12-30 is Monday, the week has â‰¥4 days in 2025, belongs to week 1 of 2025)
SELECT YEARWEEK('2024-12-30', 1) AS cross_year_mode1;
+------------------+
| cross_year_mode1 |
+------------------+
|           202501 |
+------------------+

-- mode=5 (Monday start, first week contains first Monday)
-- 2023-01-02 is Monday (first Monday of the year), the week is week 1 of 2023
SELECT YEARWEEK('2023-01-02', 5) AS yearweek_mode5;
+----------------+
| yearweek_mode5 |
+----------------+
|         202301 |
+----------------+

-- Input DATE type
SELECT YEARWEEK('2023-12-25', 1) AS date_type_mode1;
+------------------+
| date_type_mode1  |
+------------------+
|           202352 |
+------------------+

-- Input NULL (returns NULL)
SELECT YEARWEEK(NULL) AS null_input;
+------------+
| null_input |
+------------+
|       NULL |
+------------+
