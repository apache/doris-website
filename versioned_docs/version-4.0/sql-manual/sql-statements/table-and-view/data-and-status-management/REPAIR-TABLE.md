## Description

The `REPAIR TABLE` statement is used to prioritize the repair of replicas for a specified table or partition. This statement has the following functionalities:

- It can repair all replicas of an entire table.
- It can repair replicas of specified partitions.
- It performs replica repairs with high priority.
- It supports setting a repair timeout.

## Syntax

```sql
ADMIN REPAIR TABLE <table_name> [ PARTITION (<partition_name> [, ...]) ];
```

## Required Parameters

**1. `<table_name>`**

> Specifies the name of the table that needs to be repaired.
>
> The table name must be unique within its database.

## Optional Parameters

**1. `PARTITION (<partition_name> [, ...])`**

> Specifies a list of partition names that need to be repaired.
>
> If this parameter is not specified, it will repair all partitions of the entire table.

## Access Control Requirements

Users executing this SQL command must have at least the following permissions:

| Privilege       | Object      | Notes                                         |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| ADMIN           | System      | The user must have ADMIN privileges to execute this command. |

## Usage Notes

- This statement indicates that the system will attempt to repair the specified replicas with high priority, but it does not guarantee successful repairs.
- The default timeout is set to 14,400 seconds (4 hours).
- After the timeout, the system will no longer prioritize the repair of specified replicas.
- If a repair times out, the command needs to be executed again to continue the repair process.
- The progress of repairs can be monitored using the `SHOW REPLICA STATUS` command.
- This command does not affect the normal replica repair mechanism of the system; it merely elevates the priority of repairs for the specified table or partition.

## Examples

- Repair all replicas of an entire table:

    ```sql
    ADMIN REPAIR TABLE tbl1;
    ```

- Repair replicas of specified partitions:

    ```sql
    ADMIN REPAIR TABLE tbl1 PARTITION (p1, p2);
    ```

- Check the repair progress:

    ```sql
    SHOW REPLICA STATUS FROM tbl1;
    ```
