Doris version 2.1 starts to support automatic partitioning. To use this feature, please [download Doris 2.1](https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/download) and refer to the documentation for version 2.1.

:::

The Auto Partitioning feature supports automatic detection of whether the corresponding partition exists during the data import process. If it does not exist, the partition will be created automatically and imported normally.

The auto partition function mainly solves the problem that the user expects to partition the table based on a certain column, but the data distribution of the column is scattered or unpredictable, so it is difficult to accurately create the required partitions when building or adjusting the structure of the table, or the number of partitions is so large that it is too cumbersome to create them manually.

Take the time type partition column as an example, in the Dynamic Partition function, we support the automatic creation of new partitions to accommodate real-time data at specific time periods. For real-time user behavior logs and other scenarios, this feature basically meets the requirements. However, in more complex scenarios, such as dealing with non-real-time data, the partition column is independent of the current system time and contains a large number of discrete values. At this time to improve efficiency we want to partition the data based on this column, but the data may actually involve the partition can not be grasped in advance, or the expected number of required partitions is too large. In this case, dynamic partitioning or manually created partitions can not meet our needs, automatic partitioning function is very good to cover such needs.

Suppose our table DDL is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `DAILY_TRADE_VALUE`
(
    `TRADE_DATE`              datev2 NOT NULL COMMENT 'TRADE_DATE',
    `TRADE_ID`                varchar(40) NOT NULL COMMENT 'TRADE_ID',
    ......
)
UNIQUE KEY(`TRADE_DATE`, `TRADE_ID`)
PARTITION BY RANGE(`TRADE_DATE`)
(
    PARTITION p_2000 VALUES [('2000-01-01'), ('2001-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2001 VALUES [('2001-01-01'), ('2002-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2002 VALUES [('2002-01-01'), ('2003-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2003 VALUES [('2003-01-01'), ('2004-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2004 VALUES [('2004-01-01'), ('2005-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2005 VALUES [('2005-01-01'), ('2006-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2006 VALUES [('2006-01-01'), ('2007-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2007 VALUES [('2007-01-01'), ('2008-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2008 VALUES [('2008-01-01'), ('2009-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2009 VALUES [('2009-01-01'), ('2010-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2010 VALUES [('2010-01-01'), ('2011-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2011 VALUES [('2011-01-01'), ('2012-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2012 VALUES [('2012-01-01'), ('2013-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2013 VALUES [('2013-01-01'), ('2014-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2014 VALUES [('2014-01-01'), ('2015-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2015 VALUES [('2015-01-01'), ('2016-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2016 VALUES [('2016-01-01'), ('2017-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2017 VALUES [('2017-01-01'), ('2018-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2018 VALUES [('2018-01-01'), ('2019-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2019 VALUES [('2019-01-01'), ('2020-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2020 VALUES [('2020-01-01'), ('2021-01-01')),
    PARTITION p_2021 VALUES [('2021-01-01'), ('2022-01-01'))
)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`TRADE_DATE`) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES (
  "replication_num" = "1"
);
```

The table stores a large amount of business history data, partitioned based on the date the transaction occurred. As you can see when building the table, we need to manually create the partitions in advance. If the data range of the partitioned columns changes, for example, 2022 is added to the above table, we need to create a partition by [ALTER-TABLE-PARTITION](../sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Definition-Statements/Alter/ALTER-TABLE-PARTITION) to make changes to the table partition. If such partitions need to be changed, or subdivided at a finer level of granularity, it is very tedious to modify them. At this point we can rewrite the table DDL using AUTO PARTITION.
