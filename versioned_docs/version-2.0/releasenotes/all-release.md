This document presents a summary of Apache Doris versions released within one year, listed in reverse chronological order.

:::tip Latest Release

ðŸŽ‰ Version 3.0.3 released now. Check out the ðŸ”—[Release Notes](../releasenotes/v3.0/release-3.0.3) here. Starting from version 3.X, Apache Doris supports a compute-storage decoupled mode in addition to the compute-storage coupled mode for cluster deployment. With the cloud-native architecture that decouples the computation and storage layers, users can achieve physical isolation between query loads across multiple compute clusters, as well as isolation between read and write loads. 

<br />

ðŸŽ‰ Version 2.1.7 released now. Check out the ðŸ”—[Release Notes](../releasenotes/v2.1/release-2.1.6) here. The 2.1 version delivers exceptional performance with 100% higher out-of-the-box queries proven by TPC-DS 1TB tests, enhanced data lake analytics that are 4-6 times speedier than Trino and Spark, solid support for semi-structured data analysis with new Variant types and suite of analytical functions, asynchronous materialized views for query acceleration, optimized real-time writing at scale, and better workload management with stability and runtime SQL resource tracking.
