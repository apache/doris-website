After planning the cluster topology, you can deploy the Doris cluster in Kubernetes.

## Deploy cluster

### Deploy using Custom Resource files

**Online Deployment**

Deploying a cluster online requires the following steps:

1. Create namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace ${namespace}
```

2. Deploy Doris cluster

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./${cluster_sample}.yaml -n ${namespace}
```

**Offline deployment**

To deploy Doris cluster offline, you need to upload the docker image used by Doris cluster to all nodes on a machine with external network. Then use docker load to install the image on the server. Offline deployment requires the following steps:

1. Download the required image

Deploying Doris cluster requires the following images:

```text
selectdb/doris.fe-ubuntu:2.0.2
selectdb/doris.be-ubuntu:2.0.2
```

Download the image locally and package it into a tar file

```shell
## download docker image
docker pull selectdb/doris.fe-ubuntu:2.0.2
docker pull selectdb/doris.be-ubuntu:2.0.2

## save docker image as a tar package
docker save -o doris.fe-ubuntu-v2.0.2.tar selectdb/doris.fe-ubuntu:2.0.2
docker save -o doris.be-ubuntu-v2.0.2.tar docker pull selectdb/doris.be-ubuntu:2.0.2
```

Upload the image tar package to the server and execute the docker load command:

```shell
## load docker image
docker load -i doris.fe-ubuntu-v2.0.2.tar
docker load -i doris.be-ubuntu-v2.0.2.tar
```

2. Create namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace ${namespace}
```

3. Deploy Doris cluster

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./${cluster_sample}.yaml -n ${namespace}
```

### Deploy using Helm

**Online Deployment**

Before installation, you need to add a deployment warehouse. If it has been added, you can directly install Doris Cluster. Otherwise, please refer to the operation of **Add Deployment Warehouse** when adding [Deploy Doris Operator](<./install-operator.md#Option 3: Helm deploys Doris Operator>)

1. Install Doris Cluster

Install [doriscluster](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/doris/doris), using the default configuration this deployment only deploys 3 FE and 3 BE components, using the default `storageClass` to implement PV dynamic provisioning.

```shell
helm install doriscluster doris-repo/doris
```

If you need to customize resources and cluster shapes, please customize the resource configuration according to the annotations of each resource configuration in [values.yaml](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/doris/doris?modal=values) and execute The following command:

```shell
helm install -f values.yaml doriscluster doris-repo/doris
```

2. Verify doris cluster installation results

You can check the pod deployment status through the `kubectl get pods` command. When the Pod of `doriscluster` is in `Running` state and all containers in the Pod are ready, the deployment is successful.

```shell
kubectl get pod --namespace doris
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
doriscluster-helm-fe-0   1/1     Running   0          1m39s
doriscluster-helm-fe-1   1/1     Running   0          1m39s
doriscluster-helm-fe-2   1/1     Running   0          1m39s
doriscluster-helm-be-0   1/1     Running   0          16s
doriscluster-helm-be-1   1/1     Running   0          16s
doriscluster-helm-be-2   1/1     Running   0          16s
```

**Offline deployment**

1. Download the Doris Cluster Chart resource

Download `doris-{chart_version}.tgz` to install Doris Cluster chart. If you need to download the 2.0.6 version of the Doris cluster, you can use the following command:

```shell
wget https://charts.selectdb.com/doris-2.0.6.tgz
```

2. Install Doris cluster

Doris cluster can be installed through the `helm install` command.

```shell
helm install doriscluster doris-1.4.0.tgz
```

If you need to customize the assembly [values.yaml](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/doris/doris?modal=values), you can refer to the following command:

```shell
helm install -f values.yaml doriscluster doris-1.4.0.tgz
```

3. Verify doris cluster installation results

You can check the pod deployment status through the `kubectl get pods` command. When the Pod of `doriscluster` is in `Running` state and all containers in the Pod are ready, the deployment is successful.

```shell
kubectl get pod --namespace doris
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
doriscluster-helm-fe-0   1/1     Running   0          1m39s
doriscluster-helm-fe-1   1/1     Running   0          1m39s
doriscluster-helm-fe-2   1/1     Running   0          1m39s
doriscluster-helm-be-0   1/1     Running   0          16s
doriscluster-helm-be-1   1/1     Running   0          16s
doriscluster-helm-be-2   1/1     Running   0          16s
```

## View cluster status

### Check cluster status

After the cluster deployment resources are delivered, you can check the cluster status by running the following command.

```shell
kubectl get pods -n ${namespace}
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
doriscluster-sample-fe-0   1/1     Running   0          20m
doriscluster-sample-be-0   1/1     Running   0          19m
```

When the `STATUS` of all pods is in the `Running` state, and all containers in the pods of all components are `READY`, it means that the entire cluster is deployed normally.

### Check deployment resource status

Doris Operator will collect the status of cluster services and display them in the distributed resources. Doris Operator defines the abbreviation `dcr` for the `DorisCluster` type resource name, which can be replaced by the abbreviation when using the resource type to view the cluster status.

```shell
kubectl get dcr
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
NAME                  FESTATUS    BESTATUS    CNSTATUS   BROKERSTATUS
doriscluster-sample   available   available
```

When the `STATUS` of the configured related services is `available`, the cluster deployment is successful.
