# Manually Trigger Compaction

## Request

`POST /api/compaction/run?tablet_id={int}&compact_type={enum}`
`POST /api/compaction/run?table_id={int}&compact_type=full` Note that table_id=xxx will take effect only when compact_type=full is specified.
`GET /api/compaction/run_status?tablet_id={int}`


## Description

Used to manually trigger the comparison and show status.

## Query parameters

* `tablet_id`
    - ID of the tablet

* `table_id`
    - ID of table. Note that table_id=xxx will take effect only when compact_type=full is specified, and only one tablet_id and table_id can be specified, and cannot be specified at the same time. After specifying table_id, full_compaction will be automatically executed for all tablets under this table.

* `compact_type`
    - The value is `base` or `cumulative` or `full`. For usage scenarios of full_compaction, please refer to [Data Recovery](../../data-admin/data-recovery.md).

## Request body

## Response

### Trigger Compaction

If the tablet does not exist, an error in JSON format is returned:

```
{
    "status": "Fail",
    "msg": "Tablet not found"
}
```

If the tablet exists and the tablet is not running, JSON format is returned:

```
{
    "status": "Fail",
    "msg": "fail to execute compaction, error = -2000"
}
```

If the tablet exists and the tablet is running, JSON format is returned:

```
{
    "status": "Success",
    "msg": "compaction task is successfully triggered."
}
```

Explanation of results:

* status: Trigger task status, when it is successfully triggered, it is Success; when for some reason (for example, the appropriate version is not obtained), it returns Fail.
* msg: Give specific success or failure information.

    "tablet_id" : 11308,
    "schema_hash" : 700967178,
