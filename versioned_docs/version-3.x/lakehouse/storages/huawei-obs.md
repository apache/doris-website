## Example Configuration

```properties
"obs.access_key" = "your-access-key",
"obs.secret_key" = "your-secret-key",
"obs.endpoint" = "obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com",
"obs.region" = "cn-north-4"
```

For versions before 3.1:

```properties
"s3.access_key" = "your-access-key",
"s3.secret_key" = "your-secret-key",
"s3.endpoint" = "obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com",
"s3.region" = "cn-north-4",
```

## Usage Recommendations

* It is recommended to use the `obs.` prefix for configuration parameters to ensure consistency and clarity with Huawei Cloud OBS.
* For versions before 3.1, please use the former name with `s3.` prefix.
* Configuring `obs.region` can improve access accuracy and performance, it is recommended to set it.
* Connection pool parameters can be adjusted according to concurrency requirements to avoid connection blocking.
