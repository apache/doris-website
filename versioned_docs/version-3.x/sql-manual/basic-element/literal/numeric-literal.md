Use numeric literals to specify fixed-point and floating-point numbers.

## Integer Literal

Integers are represented as a sequence of digits. They may have a sign. For example: +1, -2, 345.

Doris determines the type used to store integer literals based on the input value. The range mapping is shown in the table below:

| Value Range         | Type     |
| :------------------ | :------- |
| -2^8 to 2^8 - 1     | TINYINT  |
| -2^16 to 2^16 - 1   | SMALLINT |
| -2^32 to 2^32 - 1   | INT      |
| -2^64 to 2^64 - 1   | BIGINT   |
| -2^128 to 2^128 - 1 | LARGEINT |

## Fixed and Floating Point Numeric Literals

Fixed and floating point numeric literals can have an integer part, a fractional part, or both. They may have a sign. For example: 1, .2, 3.4, -5, -6.78, +9.10.

They can also be represented in scientific notation, including the significand and exponent. Either part or both can have a sign. For example: 1.2E3, 1.2E-3, -1.2E3, -1.2E-3.

Numbers represented in this way are preferentially parsed as fixed-point numbers. The range of supported fixed-point numbers is controlled by the variable `enable_decimal256`. When `enable_decimal256` is `TRUE`, the maximum precision is 76. When `enable_decimal256` is `FALSE`, the maximum precision is 38.

When the precision required by a number exceeds the maximum value representable by fixed-point numbers, it is parsed as a floating-point number, with the type DOUBLE.
