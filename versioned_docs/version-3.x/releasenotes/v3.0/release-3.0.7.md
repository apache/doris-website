## Behavior Changes

- Adjust the permission requirements for `show frontends` and `show backends` to align with the corresponding RESTful API, i.e., requiring the `SELECT_PRIV` permission on the `information_schema` database
- Admin and root users with specified domains are no longer considered system users 
- Storage: The default number of concurrent transactions per database is adjusted to 10000

## New Features

### Query Optimizer

- Support MySQL's aggregate roll-up syntax `GROUP BY ... WITH ROLLUP`

### Query Execution

- `Like` statement supports `escape` syntax

### Semi-structured Data Management

- Support building non-tokenized inverted indexes and ngram bloomfilter indexes only for new data by setting the session variable `enable_add_index_for_new_data=true` 


### New Functions

- Added data functions: `cot`/`sec`/`cosec`

- Enhance the display of inverted index-related information in profiles

### Permissions

- Ranger supports setting permissions for storage vault and compute group
