## Behavior Changes

- `time_series_max_tablet_version_num` controls the maximum number of versions for tables using the time - series compaction strategy. [#51371](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/51371)
- Fixed the issue where the HDFS root_path did not take effect during hot - cold tiering. [#48441](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/48441)
- In the new optimizer (Nereids), when the depth or width of an expression in a query exceeds the threshold limit, the query will not fall back to the old optimizer regardless of whether the fallback has started. [#52431](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/52431)
- Unified the name checking rules for enabling or disabling unicode names. Now, the non - unicode name rules are a strict subset of the unicode name rules. [#53264](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/53264)
