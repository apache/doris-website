## Description

Determines the semantic similarity between two texts.

## Syntax

```sql
AI_SIMILARITY([<resource_name>], <text_1>, <text_2>)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter         | Description                |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `<resource_name>` | The specified resource name |
| `<text_1>`        | Text                      |
| `<text_2>`        | Text                      |

## Return Value

Returns a floating-point number between 0 and 10. 0 means no similarity, 10 means strong similarity.

If any input is NULL, returns NULL.

The result is generated by the large language model, so the output may not be fixed.

## Example

Suppose you have the following table representing comments received by a courier company:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_comments (
    id      INT,
    comment VARCHAR(500)
) DUPLICATE KEY(id)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES (
    "replication_num" = "1"
);
```

If you want to rank comments by customer sentiment, you can use:
```sql
SELECT comment,
    AI_SIMILARITY('resource_name', 'I am extremely dissatisfied with their service.', comment) AS score
FROM user_comments ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 5;
```

The query result may look like:
```text
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
| comment                                         | score |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
| It arrived broken and I am really disappointed. |   7.5 |
| Delivery was very slow and frustrating.         |   6.5 |
| Not bad, but the packaging could be better.     |   3.5 |
| It is fine, nothing special to mention.         |     3 |
| Absolutely fantastic, highly recommend it.      |     1 |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
