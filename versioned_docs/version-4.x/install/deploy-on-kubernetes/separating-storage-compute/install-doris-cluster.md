Deploying a functional decoupled storage and compute Doris cluster on Kubernetes involves four main steps:
1. Preparation – Primarily, install a FoundationDB cluster.
2. Deploying the Doris Operator.
3. Deploying the compute-storage decoupled cluster.
4. Creating the Storage Backend.

## Step 1: Preparation
Before deploying a decoupled cluster on Kubernetes, it is essential to have FoundationDB deployed in advance.
- (Preferred) Direct Deployment on Machines:
  Ensure that the machine where FoundationDB is installed is accessible by services running within the Kubernetes cluster. For direct machine deployments, please refer to the [Preparation Phase](../../../compute-storage-decoupled/before-deployment) in the decoupled deployment documentation.
- Deployment on Kubernetes:
  For deploying FoundationDB on Kubernetes, please refer to [Deploying FoundationDB on Kubernetes](install-fdb.md).

## Step 2: Deploying the Doris Operator
1. Create the resource definitions:
    ```shell
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/doris-operator/master/config/crd/bases/crds.yaml
    ```
   If a non-decoupled cluster has already been deployed, use the following command to create the CRD definitions:
    ```yaml
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/doris-operator/master/config/crd/bases/disaggregated.cluster.doris.com_dorisdisaggregatedclusters.yaml
    ```
2. Deploy the Doris Operator and its associated RBAC rules:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/doris-operator/master/config/operator/disaggregated-operator.yaml
    ```
   After deployment, verify the status of the Operator Pod using:
    ```shell
    kubectl -n doris get pods
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    doris-operator-6b97df65c4-xwvw8   1/1     Running   0          19s
    ```

## Step 3: Deploy the compute-storage decoupled cluster
1. Download the Deployment Sample:
    ```shell
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/doris-operator/master/doc/examples/disaggregated/cluster/ddc-sample.yaml
    ```

2. Configure FoundationDB access information.
   The compute-storage decoupled version of Doris uses FoundationDB to store metadata. The access details for FoundationDB can be provided in the DorisDisaggregatedCluster under `spec.metaService.fdb` in one of two ways: by directly specifying the access address or by using a ConfigMap that includes the access information.
    - Direct Access Address Configuration
      If FoundationDB is deployed outside of Kubernetes, you can specify its access address directly:
        ```yaml
        spec:
          metaService:
            fdb:
              address: ${fdbAddress}
        ```
      Here, ${fdbAddress} refers to the client access address for FoundationDB. On Linux VMs, this is typically stored in `/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster`. For more details, refer to the FoundationDB [cluster file documentation](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/administration.html#foundationdb-cluster-file).

    - Configuring via a ConfigMap Containing Access Information
      If FoundationDB is deployed using the [fdb-kubernetes-operator](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-kubernetes-operator), the operator will generate a specific ConfigMap containing the access information within the deployment namespace.
      The generated ConfigMap's name is the FoundationDB resource name with the suffix “-config”. After obtaining the ConfigMap's name and namespace, configure the DorisDisaggregatedCluster resource as follows:
        ```yaml
        spec:
          metaService:
            fdb:
              configMapNamespaceName:
                name: ${foundationdbConfigMapName}
                namespace: ${namespace}
        ```
      Here, {foundationdbConfigMapName} is the name of the ConfigMap generated by the fdb-kubernetes-operator, and {namespace} is the namespace where the ConfigMap resides.

3. Configure the DorisDisaggregatedCluster Resource
   Based on the decoupled deployment documentation, configure:
    - The metadata service as  detailed in the ([metaService configuration](config-ms.md)).
    - The FE cluster specifications ([FE cluster configuration](config-fe.md)).
    - The compute groups ([compute group configuration](config-cg.md)).

   After completing the configuration, deploy the resources with the following command:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ddc-sample.yaml
    ```
   Once the resources are applied, wait for the cluster to be fully established. The expected output of the following command is:
    ```shell
    kubectl get ddc
    NAME                         CLUSTERHEALTH   FEPHASE   CGCOUNT   CGAVAILABLECOUNT   CGFULLAVAILABLECOUNT
    test-disaggregated-cluster   green           Ready     2         2                  2
    ```

## Step 4: Creating the Remote Storage Backend
After the cluster has successfully started, configure an available object storage as the persistent storage backend (referred to as a Vault in Doris) using SQL.

1. Obtain the FE Service Access Address
   After the cluster is deployed, you can view the services exposed by the Doris Operator with the following command:
    ```shell
    kubectl get svc
    ```
   Example output:
    ```shell
    NAME                                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                               AGE
    test-disaggregated-cluster-fe            ClusterIP   10.96.147.97   <none>        8030/TCP,9020/TCP,9030/TCP,9010/TCP   15m
    test-disaggregated-cluster-fe-internal   ClusterIP   None           <none>        9030/TCP                              15m
    test-disaggregated-cluster-ms            ClusterIP   10.96.169.8    <none>        5000/TCP                              15m
    test-disaggregated-cluster-cg1           ClusterIP   10.96.47.90    <none>        9060/TCP,8040/TCP,9050/TCP,8060/TCP   14m
    test-disaggregated-cluster-cg2           ClusterIP   10.96.50.199   <none>        9060/TCP,8040/TCP,9050/TCP,8060/TCP   14m
    ```
   The Service without the “-internal” suffix is intended for external access.

2. Connect Using the MySQL Client
   Within the Kubernetes cluster, create a Pod containing the MySQL Client and enter the Pod:
    ```shell
    kubectl run mysql-client --image=mysql:5.7 -it --rm --restart=Never -- /bin/bash
    ```
   Within the Pod, connect to the Doris cluster directly using the Service name:、
    ```shell
    mysql -uroot -P9030 -h test-disaggregated-cluster-fe 
    ```

3. Create the Storage Backend(Vault)
   Create an object storage backend supporting the S3 protocol as the Vault using SQL. For example:
      ```mysql
      CREATE STORAGE VAULT IF NOT EXISTS s3_vault
         PROPERTIES (
             "type"="S3",
             "s3.endpoint" = "oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com",
             "s3.region" = "bj",
             "s3.bucket" = "bucket",
             "s3.root.path" = "big/data/prefix",
             "s3.access_key" = "your-ak",
             "s3.secret_key" = "your-sk",
             "provider" = "OSS" 
         );
      ```
   For instructions on creating other storage backends and detailed explanations of each field, please refer to the [Managing Storage Vault](../../../compute-storage-decoupled/managing-storage-vault.md) section of the decoupled deployment documentation.
   Set the Default Storage Vault.
   ```mysql
   SET {vaultName} AS DEFAULT STORAGE VAULT;
   ```
   Here, {vaultName} is the name of the Vault you wish to use, for example, s3_vault as created in the example above.
