- Catalog properties.
- Table Valued Function properties.
- Broker Load properties.
- Export properties.
- Outfile properties.

## Parameter Overview

| Property Name                | Legacy Name | Description                                      | Default | Required |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| s3.endpoint                  |             | S3 service access endpoint, e.g., s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com | None    | No       |
| s3.access_key                |             | AWS Access Key for authentication               | None    | No       |

| s3.connection.maximum        |             | Maximum number of connections for high concurrency scenarios | 50      | No       |
| s3.connection.request.timeout|             | Request timeout (milliseconds), controls connection acquisition timeout | 3000    | No       |
| s3.connection.timeout        |             | Connection establishment timeout (milliseconds) | 1000    | No       |
| s3.role_arn                  |             | Role ARN specified when using Assume Role mode  | None    | No       |

## Authentication Configuration

Doris supports the following two methods to access S3:

1. Direct Access Key and Secret Key

  ```properties
  "s3.access_key"="your-access-key",
  "s3.secret_key"="your-secret-key",
  "s3.endpoint"="s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  "s3.region"="us-east-1"
  ```

2. Assume Role Mode

  Suitable for cross-account and temporary authorization access. Automatically obtains temporary credentials through role authorization.

  ```properties
  "s3.role_arn"="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/demo-role",
  "s3.external_id"="external-identifier",
  "s3.endpoint"="s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  "s3.region"="us-east-1"
  ```

> If both Access Key and Role ARN are configured, Access Key mode takes precedence.

For instructions on AWS authentication and authorization configuration, please refer to the document [aws-authentication-and-authorization](../../admin-manual/auth/integrations/aws-authentication-and-authorization.md)

## Accessing S3 Directory Bucket

> This feature is supported since version 3.1.0.

Amazon S3 Express One Zone (also known as Directory Bucket) provides higher performance, but has a different endpoint format.

To connect to an AWS S3 Express One Zone Directory Bucket you will need to add another property option listed below:

```Properties
"s3_validity_check" = "false"
```
* "s3_validity_check" = "false" disabled the pingS3 check that commonly fails during storage vault configuration for Directory Buckets.

* Regular bucket: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
* Directory Bucket: s3express-usw2-az1.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

For more available regions, refer to: [AWS Official Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-Regions-and-Zones.html)

Example:

```properties
"s3.access_key"="ak",
"s3.secret_key"="sk",
"s3.endpoint"="s3express-usw2-az1.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
"s3.region"="us-west-2"
"s3_validity_check" = "false" 
```

## Permission Policies

Depending on the use case, permissions can be categorized into **read-only** and **read-write** policies.

### 1. Read-only Permissions

Only allows reading objects from S3. Suitable for LOAD, TVF, querying EXTERNAL CATALOG, and other scenarios.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:GetObjectVersion",
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket>/your-prefix/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket>"
        }    
    ]
}
```

### 2. Read-write Permissions

Based on read-only permissions, additionally allows deleting, creating, and modifying objects. Suitable for EXPORT, OUTFILE, and EXTERNAL CATALOG write-back scenarios.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:GetObjectVersion",
              "s3:DeleteObject",
              "s3:DeleteObjectVersion",
              "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",      
              "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket>/<your-prefix>/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
                "s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket>"
        }    
    ]
}
```

### Notes

1. Placeholder Replacement

    - `<bucket>` → Your S3 Bucket name.
    - `<account-id>` → Your AWS account ID (12-digit number).

2. Principle of Least Privilege

    - If only querying, do not grant write permissions.
