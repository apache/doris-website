# TPC-DS Benchmark

TPC-DS (Transaction Processing Performance Council Decision Support Benchmark) is a benchmark test that focuses on decision support and aims to evaluate the performance of data warehousing and analytics systems. It was developed by the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) organization to compare the capabilities of different systems in handling complex queries and large-scale data analysis.

The design goal of TPC-DS is to simulate complex decision support workloads in the real world. It tests the performance of systems through a series of complex queries and data operations, including joins, aggregations, sorting, filtering, subqueries, and more. These query patterns cover various scenarios ranging from simple to complex, such as report generation, data mining, and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).

This document mainly introduces the performance of Doris on the TPC-DS 1000G test set.

On 99 queries on the TPC-DS standard test data set, we conducted a comparison test based on Apache Doris 3.0.3-rc03 (Compute-Storage Coupled Mode) and Apache Doris 2.1.7-rc03 versions. The performance of the integrated storage and computing mode in version 3.x is based on version 2.1.x

## 4. Test SQL

TPC-DS 99 test query statements : [TPC-DS-Query-SQL](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/tpcds-tools/queries/sf1000)

## 5. Test Results

Here we use Apache Doris 3.0.3-rc03 (Compute-Storage Coupled Mode) and Apache Doris 2.1.7-rc03 for comparative testing. In the test, we use Query Time(ms) as the main performance indicator.
The test results are as follows:

## 6. Environmental Preparation

Please refer to the [official document](../install/cluster-deployment/standard-deployment.md) to install and deploy Doris to obtain a normal running Doris cluster (at least 1 FE 1 BE, 1 FE 3 BE is recommended).

## 7. Data Preparation

### 7.1 Download and Install TPC-DS Data Generation Tool

Execute the following script to download and compile the [tpcds-tools](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/tpcds-tools) tool.

```shell
sh bin/build-tpcds-dbgen.sh
```

### 7.2 Generating the TPC-DS Test Set

Execute the following script to generate the TPC-H dataset:

```shell
sh bin/gen-tpcds-data.sh -s 1000
```

> Note 1: Check the script help via `sh gen-tpcds-data.sh -h`.
>
> Note 2: The data will be generated under the `tpcds-data/` directory with the suffix `.dat`. The total file size is about 1000GB and may need a few minutes to an hour to generate.
>
> Note 3: A standard test data set of 100G is generated by default.

### 7.3 Create Table

#### 7.3.1 Prepare the `doris-cluster.conf` File

Before import the script, you need to write the FEâ€™s ip port and other information in the `doris-cluster.conf` file.

The file is located under `${DORIS_HOME}/tools/tpcds-tools/conf/` .

The content of the file includes FE's ip, HTTP port, user name, password and the DB name of the data to be imported:

```shell
# Any of FE host
export FE_HOST='127.0.0.1'
# http_port in fe.conf
export FE_HTTP_PORT=8030
# query_port in fe.conf
export FE_QUERY_PORT=9030
# Doris username
export USER='root'
# Doris password
export PASSWORD=''
# The database where TPC-H tables located
export DB='tpcds'
```

#### Execute the Following Script to Generate and Create TPC-H Table

```shell
sh bin/create-tpcds-tables.sh -s 1000
```
Or copy the table creation statement in [create-tpcds-tables](https://github.com/apache/doris/blob/master/tools/tpcds-tools/ddl/create-tpcds-tables-sf1000) and excute it in Doris.


### 7.4 Import Data

Please perform data import with the following command:

```shell
sh bin/load-tpcds-data.sh
```


### 7.5 Query Test

#### 7.5.1 Executing Query Scripts

Execute the above test SQL or execute the following command

```
sh bin/run-tpcds-queries.sh -s 1000
```

#### 7.5.2 Single SQL Execution

You can also retrieve the latest SQL from the code repository. The address for the latest test query statements of [TPC-DS](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/tpcds-tools/queries/sf1000).
