## Retrieve the List of Queries

Syntax:


```sql
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
```

This command displays all current connections to the FE and the list of queries being executed on each connection. For example:

```sql
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
+------------------+------+------+--------------------+---------------------+----------+---------+---------+------+-------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- Id is the unique identifier for the connection, also known as processlist_id.
- QueryId is the unique identifier for the query.



## Kill Query

Syntax:


```sql
KILL QUERY query_id | processlist_id
```

This command is used to terminate a specific query or the query being executed on a specific connection. For example:

```sql
kill query 55;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

This terminates the query currently running on the connection with Id=55, but the connection itself remains active.

```sql
kill query 'f02603dc163a4da3-beebbb5d1ced760c';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

This terminates the query with QueryId=f02603dc163a4da3-beebbb5d1ced760c, which is actually the same query as the one with processlist_id=55.

## Kill Connection

Syntax:


```sql
KILL CONNECTION processlist_id
```

For example:


```sql
kill CONNECTION 55;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

This command disconnects the connection with Id=55, and any query currently being executed on this connection will also be canceled.
