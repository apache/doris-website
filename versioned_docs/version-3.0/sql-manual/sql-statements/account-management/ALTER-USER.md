## Description

The `ALTER USER` statement is used to modify a user's account attributes, including passwords, and password policies, etc.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER USER [IF EXISTS] <user_identity> [IDENTIFIED BY <password>]
[<password_policy>]
[<comment>]

password_policy:
    1. PASSWORD_HISTORY { <n> | DEFAULT }
    2. PASSWORD_EXPIRE { DEFAULT | NEVER | INTERVAL <n> { DAY | HOUR | SECOND }}
    3. FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS <n>
    4. PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME { UNBOUNDED ｜ <n> { DAY | HOUR | SECOND }}
    5. ACCOUNT_UNLOCK
```

## Required Parameters

**1. `<user_identity`>**

> A user_identity uniquely identifies a user.The syntax is:'user_name'@'host'.
> `user_identity` consists of two parts, user_name and host, where username is the username. Host identifies the host address where the client connects. The host part can use % for fuzzy matching. If no host is specified, it defaults to '%', which means the user can connect to Doris from any host.
> The host part can also be specified as a domain, the syntax is: 'user_name'@['domain'], even if it is surrounded by square brackets, Doris will think this is a domain and try to resolve its ip address. 

## Optional Parameters

**1. `<password>`**

> Specify the user password. 

**2. `<password_policy>`**

> `password_policy` is a clause used to specify policies related to password authentication login. Currently, the following policies are supported:
>
> `PASSWORD_HISTORY { <n> | DEFAULT }`
>
>    Whether to allow the current user to use historical passwords when resetting their passwords. For example, `PASSWORD_HISTORY 10` means that it is forbidden to use the password set in the past 10 times as a new password. If set to `PASSWORD_HISTORY DEFAULT`, the value in the global variable `password_history` will be used. `0` means do not enable this feature. Default is 0.
>
> `PASSWORD_EXPIRE { DEFAULT | NEVER | INTERVAL <n> { DAY | HOUR | SECOND }}`
>
>    Set the expiration time of the current user's password. For example `PASSWORD_EXPIRE INTERVAL 10 DAY` means the password will expire in 10 days. `PASSWORD_EXPIRE NEVER` means that the password does not expire. If set to `PASSWORD_EXPIRE DEFAULT`, the value in the global variable `default_password_lifetime` is used. Defaults to NEVER (or 0), which means it will not expire.
>
> `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS <n>` 
>
> When the current user logs in, if the user logs in with the wrong password for n times, the account will be locked.For example, `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 3` means that if you log in wrongly for 3 times, the account will be locked.
>   
> `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME { UNBOUNDED ｜ <n> { DAY | HOUR | SECOND }}`
>
> When the account is locked, the lock time is set. For example, `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 1 DAY` means that the account will be locked for one day.
>
> `ACCOUNT_UNLOCK`
>    
> `ACCOUNT_UNLOCK` is used to unlock a locked user.

**3. `<comment>`**

>Specify the user comment.
