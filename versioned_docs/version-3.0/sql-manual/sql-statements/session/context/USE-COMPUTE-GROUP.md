## Description

In the storage-and-compute-separated version, specify the compute cluster to use.

## Syntax


```sql
USE { [ <catalog_name>. ]<database_name>[ @<compute_group_name> ] | @<compute_group_name> }
```

## Required Parameters

`<compute_group_name>`ï¼š The name of the compute cluster.

## Return Value

If the compute cluster switch is successful, it returns "Database changed"; if the switch fails, it returns the corresponding error message.

## Examples

1. Specify the compute cluster `compute_cluster` to use:

    ```sql
    use @compute_cluster;
    Database changed
    ```

2. Specify both the database `mysql` and the compute cluster `compute_cluster` to use:

    ```sql
    use mysql@compute_cluster
    Database changed
    ```

## Permission Control

The prerequisite for successfully executing this SQL command is to have the USAGE_PRIV permission for the compute group, refer to the permission documentation.

| Privilege  | Object        | Notes                                 |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| USAGE_PRIV | Compute group | Permission to use the compute cluster |

If a user does not have the compute group permission and tries to specify a compute group, an error will be reported. For example, `test` is a regular user without compute group permission:

```sql
mysql -utest -h175.40.1.1 -P9030

use @compute_cluster;
ERROR 5042 (42000): errCode = 2, detailMessage = USAGE denied to user test'@'127.0.0.1' for compute group 'compute_cluster'
```


## Notes

1. If the database name or compute group name is a reserved keyword, it needs to be enclosed in backticks, for example:

    ```sql
    use @`create`
    ```

2. If the compute group does not exist, an error message will be returned:

    ```sql
    mysql> use @compute_group_not_exist;
    ERROR 5098 (42000): errCode = 2, detailMessage = Compute Group compute_group_not_exist not exist
    ```
