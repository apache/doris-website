```
## Required Parameters

**1.`<db_name>`**
> Specifies the identifier (name) for the database.

## Access Control Requirements

The user executing this SQL command must have at least the following permissions:


| Privilege       | Object    | Notes                      |
|:----------------|:----------|:---------------------------|
| Drop_priv       | Table     | TRUNCATE TABLE belongs to the table DROP operation |

## Usage Notes

- This statement clears data but retains the table or partition.
- Unlike DELETE, this statement can only clear the specified table or partition as a whole and cannot add filtering conditions.
- Unlike DELETE, clearing data in this way will not affect query performance.
- The data deleted by this operation cannot be recovered.
- When using this command, the table status must be NORMAL, that is, operations such as SCHEMA CHANGE are not allowed.
- This command may cause the import in progress to fail.

## Examples

1. Clear the table tbl under example_db

    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE example_db.tbl;
    ```

2. Clear the p1 and p2 partitions of table tbl

    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE tbl PARTITION(p1, p2);
    ```
