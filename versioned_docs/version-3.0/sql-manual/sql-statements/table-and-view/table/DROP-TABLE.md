## Description

This statement is used to delete a Table.
## Syntax

```sql
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] [<db_name>.]<table_name> [FORCE];
```

## Required Parameters
**1.`<table_name>`**
> Specifies the table identifier (name), which must be unique within the database in which it is located.
>
> Identifiers must begin with an alphabetic character (or any character in a language if unicode name support is enabled) and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier string is enclosed in backticks (e.g. `My Object`).
>
> Identifiers cannot use reserved keywords.
>
> For more details, see Identifier Requirements and Reserved Keywords.

## Optional Parameters

**1.`<db_name>`**
> Specifies the identifier (name) for the database.
>
> Identifiers must begin with an alphabetic character (or any character in a given language if unicode name support is enabled) and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier string is enclosed in backticks (e.g., `My Database`).
>
> Identifiers cannot use reserved keywords.
>
> See Identifier Requirements and Reserved Keywords for more details.

**2.`FORCE`**
> If specified, the system will not check whether there are any unfinished transactions in the table. The table will be deleted directly and cannot be recovered. This operation is generally not recommended.

## Access Control Requirements

The user executing this SQL command must have at least the following permissions:


| Privilege       | Object    | Notes                      |
|:----------------|:----------|:---------------------------|
| Drop_priv       | Table     | DROP TABLE belongs to the table DROP operation |

## Usage Notes

- After executing `DROP TABLE` for a period of time, the deleted table can be restored by using the RECOVER statement. For details, see the [RECOVER](../../../../sql-manual/sql-statements/Database-Administration-Statements/RECOVER) statement.
- If you execute `DROP TABLE FORCE`, the system will not check whether there are unfinished transactions for the table. The table will be deleted directly and cannot be restored. Generally, this operation is not recommended.
