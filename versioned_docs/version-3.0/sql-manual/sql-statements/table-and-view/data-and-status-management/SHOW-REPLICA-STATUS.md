## Description

This statement is used to display the replica status information for a table or partition.

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW REPLICA STATUS FROM [ <database_name>.]<table_name> [<partition_list>] 
[where_clause]
```
Where:

```sql
partition_list
  : PARTITION (<partition_name>[ , ... ])
```

Where:

```sql
where_clause
: WHERE <output_column_name> = <value>
```

## Required Parameters

**1. `<table_name>`**

> The identifier (i.e., name) of the table, which must be unique within the database (Database).
>
> The identifier must start with a letter character (or any character from supported languages if Unicode name support is enabled), and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier string is enclosed in backticks (e.g., My Object).
>
> Identifiers cannot use reserved keywords.
>
> For more details, refer to the identifier requirements and reserved keywords.


## Optional Parameters

**1. `<db_name>`**

> The identifier (i.e., name) of the database, which must be unique within the cluster (Cluster).
>
> The identifier must start with a letter character (or any character from supported languages if Unicode name support is enabled), and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier string is enclosed in backticks (e.g., My Object).
>
> Identifiers cannot use reserved keywords.
>
> For more details, refer to the identifier requirements and reserved keywords.

**2. `<partition_list>`**

> A comma-separated list of partition identifiers (i.e., names), which must be unique within the table (Table).
>
> The identifier must start with a letter character (or any character from supported languages if Unicode name support is enabled), and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier string is enclosed in backticks (e.g., My Object).
>
> Identifiers cannot use reserved keywords.
>
> For more details, refer to the identifier requirements and reserved keywords.

**3. `WHERE <output_column_name> = <value>`**

> Specifies the filtering condition for the output. The output_column_name must be part of the output field list.
>
> When output_column_name is STATUS, the value can be one of the following:
>
> - DEAD:           The backend where the replica resides is unavailable.
> - VERSION_ERROR:  The replicaâ€™s data version is incomplete.
> - SCHEMA_ERROR:   The schema hash of the replica is incorrect.
> - MISSING:        The replica does not exist.

| LastFailedVersion  | Int      | The version when the replica last failed. A value of -1 means no failure. |

| IsBad              | Boolean  | Indicates whether the replica is in a bad state (true/false).             |
| IsUserDrop         | Boolean  | Indicates if the replica has been marked for user-driven deletion.        |
| State              | String   | The current state of the replica (e.g., NORMAL).                          |
| Status             | String   | The health status of the replica (e.g., OK).                              |
