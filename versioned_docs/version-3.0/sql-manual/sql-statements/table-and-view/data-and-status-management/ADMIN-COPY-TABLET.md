## Description

This statement is used to make a snapshot for the specified tablet, mainly used to load the tablet locally to reproduce
the problem.

## Syntax

```sql
ADMIN COPY TABLET <tablet_id> PROPERTIES ("<key>"="<value>" [,...]).
```

## Required Parameters

**1. `<tablet_id>`**

The ID of the tablet to be copied.

## Optional Parameters

  ```sql
  [ PROPERTIES ("<key>"="<value>" [, ... ]) ]
  ```

The PROPERTIES clause allows specifying additional parameters:

**1. `<backend_id>`**

Specifies the id of the BE node where the replica is located. If not specified, a replica is randomly selected.

**2. `<version>`**

Specifies the version of the snapshot. The version must be less than or equal to the largest version of the replica. If
not specified, the largest version is used.

**3. `<expiration_minutes>`**

Snapshot retention time. The default is 1 hour. It will automatically clean up after a timeout. Unit minutes.

## Return Value

## Examples

- Take a snapshot of the replica on the specified BE node

  ```sql
  ADMIN COPY TABLET 10020 PROPERTIES("backend_id" = "10003");
  ```
  
  ```text
           TabletId: 10020
          BackendId: 10003
                 Ip: 192.168.10.1

  PROPERTIES (
  "replication_num" = "1",
  "version_info" = "2"

  ```sql
  ADMIN COPY TABLET 10010 PROPERTIES("backend_id" = "10003", "version" = "10");
  ```
  
  ```text
           TabletId: 10010
          BackendId: 10003
