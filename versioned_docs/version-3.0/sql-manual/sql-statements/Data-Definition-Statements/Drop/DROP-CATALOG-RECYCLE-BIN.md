## DROP-CATALOG-RECYCLE-BIN

### Name

DROP CATALOG RECYCLE BIN

### Description

This statement is used to delete db/table/partition in catalog recycle bin instantly.

You can get all meta informations that can be deleted by statement `SHOW CATALOG RECYCLE BIN`.

grammar:

1. delete database by DbId

  ```sql
  DROP CATALOG RECYCLE BIN WHERE 'DbId' = db_id;
  ```

2. delete table by TableId

  ```sql
  DROP CATALOG RECYCLE BIN WHERE 'TableId' = table_id;
  ```

 3. delete partition by PartitionId

  ```sql
  DROP CATALOG RECYCLE BIN WHERE 'PartitionId' = partition_id;
  ```

illustrate:

- When drop db/table/partition, the catalog recycle bin will delete them after catalog_trash_expire_second(in fe.conf) seconds. This statement will delete them to free disk usage timely.
- `'DbId'`, `'TableId'` and `'PartitionId'` will be case-insensitive and not distinguish between `'` and `''`.
- When drop a database which is not in catalog recycle bin, it will also delete all tables and partitions with same DbId in catalog recycle bin. Only if nothing is deletedï¼Œit will report an error. When drop a table which is not in catalog recycle bin, the treatment is similar.

### Example

1. Delete the database(include tables and partitions with same DbId) with id example_db_id

  ```sql
  DROP CATALOG RECYCLE BIN WHERE 'DbId' = example_db_id;
  ```

2. Delete the table(include partitions with same TableId) with id example_tbl_id

  ```sql
  DROP CATALOG RECYCLE BIN WHERE 'TableId' = example_tbl_id;
  ```

3. Delete the partition with id p1_id

  ```sql
  DROP CATALOG RECYCLE BIN WHERE 'PartitionId' = p1_id;
  ```
