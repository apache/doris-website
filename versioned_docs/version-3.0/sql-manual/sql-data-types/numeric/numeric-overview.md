Doris supports the following numeric data types:

## BOOLEAN

There are two possible values: 0 represents false, and 1 represents true.

For more info, please refer [BOOLEAN](../numeric/BOOLEAN.md)ã€‚

## Integer

All are signed integers. The differences among the INT types are the number of bytes occupied and the range of values they can represent:

- **[TINYINT](../numeric/TINYINT.md)**: 1 byte, [-128, 127]

- **[SMALLINT](../numeric/SMALLINT.md)**: 2 bytes, [-32768, 32767]

- **[INT](../numeric/INT.md)**: 4 bytes, [-2147483648, 2147483647]

- **[BIGINT](../numeric/BIGINT.md)**: 8 bytes, [-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807]

- **[LARGEINT](../numeric/LARGEINT.md)**: 16 bytes, [-2^127, 2^127 - 1]


## Floating-point types


Including imprecise floating-point types [FLOAT](../numeric/FLOAT.md) and [DOUBLE](../numeric/DOUBLE.md), corresponding to the `float` and `double` in common programming languages

## Fixed-point type

The precise fixed-point type [DECIMAL](../numeric/DECIMAL.md), used in financial and other cases that require strict accuracy.
