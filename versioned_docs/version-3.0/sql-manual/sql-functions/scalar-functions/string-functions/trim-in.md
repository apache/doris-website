## Description

The TRIM_IN function removes specified characters from both ends of a string. When no character set is specified, it removes leading and trailing spaces by default. When a character set is specified, it removes all specified characters from both ends (regardless of their order in the set).
The key feature of TRIM_IN is that it removes any combination of characters from the specified set, while the TRIM function removes characters based on exact string matching.

## Syntax

```sql
TRIM_IN(<str>[, <rhs>])
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<str>` | The string to be processed. Type: VARCHAR                              |
| `<rhs>` | Optional parameter, the set of characters to be removed. Type: VARCHAR |

## Return Value

Returns VARCHAR type, representing the processed string.

Special cases:
- If str is NULL, returns NULL
- If rhs is not specified, removes all leading and trailing spaces
- If rhs is specified, removes all characters from both ends that appear in rhs until encountering the first character not in rhs

## Examples

1. Remove spaces from both ends:
```sql
SELECT trim_in(' hello ');
```
```text
+------+
| str  |
+------+
| hello|
+------+
```

2. Remove specified character set:
```sql
-- TRIM_IN removes any 'c', 'd', or 'e' characters from both ends
SELECT trim_in('abcd', 'cde');
```
```text
+------+
| str  |
+------+
| ab   |
+------+
```

3. Comparison with TRIM function
```sql
SELECT trim_in('abcd', 'cde'),trim('abcd', 'cde');
```
```text
+------------------------+---------------------+
| trim_in('abcd', 'cde') | trim('abcd', 'cde') |
+------------------------+---------------------+
| ab                     | abcd                |
+------------------------+---------------------+
```
