## Description

LAG() is a window function that accesses data from previous rows without performing a self-join. It retrieves values from a row that is N rows before the current row within a partition.

## Syntax

```sql
LAG ( <expr> [, <offset> [, <default> ] ] )
```

## Parameters
| Parameter           | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| expr                | The expression whose value is to be retrieved                                                      |
| offset              | Optional. Number of rows to look backward. Default is 1. When negative, behaves like LEAD function |
| default             | Optional. Value to return when the offset goes beyond window bounds. Default is NULL               |

## Return Value

Returns the same data type as the input expression.

## Examples

Calculate the difference between each salesperson's current sales amount and the previous day's sales amount:

```sql
select stock_symbol, closing_date, closing_price,    
lag(closing_price,1, 0) over (partition by stock_symbol order by closing_date) as "yesterday closing"   
from stock_ticker   
order by closing_date;
```

```text
+--------------+---------------------+---------------+-------------------+
| stock_symbol | closing_date        | closing_price | yesterday closing |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
