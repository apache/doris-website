### Best Prac

Transparent query for tables in jdbc catalog data source

```sql
select * from query("catalog" = "jdbc", "query" = "select * from test.student");
+------+---------+
| id   | name    |
+------+---------+
| 1    | alice   |
| 2    | bob     |
| 3    | jack    |
+------+---------+
select * from query("catalog" = "jdbc", "query" = "select * from test.score");
+------+---------+

| 2    | 90      |
| 3    | 80      |
+------+---------+
```

Transparent join query for tables in jdbc catalog data source

```sql
select * from query("catalog" = "jdbc", "query" = "select a.id, a.name, b.score from test.student a join test.score b on a.id = b.id");
+------+---------+---------+
| id   | name    | score   |
