# Star Schema Benchmark

[Star Schema Benchmark(SSB)](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/StarSchemaB.PDF) is a lightweight performance test set in the data warehouse scenario. SSB provides a simplified star schema data based on [TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/), which is mainly used to test the performance of multi-table JOIN query under star schema.  In addition, the industry usually flattens SSB into a wide table model (Referred as: SSB flat) to test the performance of the query engine, refer to [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/zh/getting-started).

This document mainly introduces the performance of Doris on the SSB 1000G test set.

We tested 13 queries on the SSB standard test dataset based on Apache Doris version 2.0.6.

## 6. Environment Preparation

Please first refer to the [official documentation](. /install/install-deploy.md) to install and deploy Apache Doris first to obtain a Doris cluster which is working well(including at least 1 FE 1 BE, 1 FE 3 BEs is recommended).

## 7. Data Preparation

### 7.1 Download and Install the SSB Data Generation Tool.

Execute the following script to download and compile the [ssb-tools](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools) tool.

```shell
sh bin/build-ssb-dbgen.sh
```

After successful installation, the `dbgen` binary will be generated under the `ssb-dbgen/` directory.

### 7.2 Generate SSB Test Set

Execute the following script to generate the SSB dataset:

```shell
sh bin/gen-ssb-data.sh -s 1000
```

> Note 1: Check the script help via `sh gen-ssb-data.sh -h`.
>
> Note 2: The data will be generated under the `ssb-data/` directory with the suffix `.tbl`. The total file size is about 600GB and may need a few minutes to an hour to generate.
>
> Note 3: A standard test data set of 100G is generated by default.

### 7.3 Create Table

#### 7.3.1 Prepare the `doris-cluster.conf` File.

Before import the script, you need to write the FE’s ip port and other information in the `doris-cluster.conf` file.

The file is located under `${DORIS_HOME}/tools/ssb-tools/conf/`.

The content of the file includes FE's ip, HTTP port, user name, password and the DB name of the data to be imported:

```shell
# Any of FE host
export FE_HOST='127.0.0.1'
# http_port in fe.conf
export FE_HTTP_PORT=8030
# query_port in fe.conf
export FE_QUERY_PORT=9030
# Doris username
export USER='root'
# Doris password
export PASSWORD=''
# The database where SSB tables located
export DB='ssb'
```

#### 7.3.2 Execute the Following Script to Generate and Create the SSB Table:

```shell
sh bin/create-ssb-tables.sh -s 1000
```

Or copy the table creation statements in [create-ssb-tables.sql](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ddl/create-ssb-tables-sf1000.sql) and [ create-ssb-flat-table.sql](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ddl/create-ssb-flat-tables-sf1000.sql) and then execute them in the MySQL client.

### 7.4 Import data

We use the following command to complete all data import of SSB test set and SSB FLAT wide table data synthesis and then import into the table.

```shell
 sh bin/load-ssb-data.sh
```

### 7.5 Checking Imported data

```sql
select count(*) from part;
select count(*) from customer;
select count(*) from supplier;
select count(*) from dates;
select count(*) from lineorder;
select count(*) from lineorder_flat;
```

### 7.6 Query Test

- SSB-Flat Query Statement: [ ssb-flat-queries](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ssb-flat-queries)
- Standard SSB Queries: [ ssb-queries](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ssb-queries)
