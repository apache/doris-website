# User configuration item

This document mainly introduces related configuration items at the User level. The configuration of the User level is mainly effective for a single user. Each user can set their own User property. Does not affect each other.

## View configuration items

After the FE is started, on the MySQL client, use the following command to view the User configuration items:

`SHOW PROPERTY [FOR user] [LIKE key pattern]`

The specific syntax can be queried through the command: `help show property;`.

## Set configuration items

After FE is started, on the MySQL client, modify the User configuration items with the following command:

`SET PROPERTY [FOR'user'] 'key' = 'value' [,'key' ='value']`

The specific syntax can be queried through the command: `help set property;`.

User-level configuration items will only take effect for the specified users, and will not affect the configuration of other users.

## Application examples
