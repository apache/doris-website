requirements for data distribution become increasingly strict. In most cases, as the requirements for data distribution increase, the performance of Join calculations tends to improve gradually. It is important to note that if the number of buckets in a table is small, Bucket Shuffle or Colocate Join may experience a decrease in performance due to lower parallelism, potentially resulting in slower performance than Shuffle Join. This is because the Shuffle operation can more effectively balance data distribution, thereby providing higher parallelism in subsequent processing."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"faq",children:"FAQ"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Bucket Shuffle Join and Colocate Join have specific limitations regarding data distribution and JOIN conditions when applied.
