Similar to aggregate functions, analytic functions also perform calculations on multiple input rows to obtain a data value. The difference is that the analytic function processes the input data within a specific window, rather than grouping calculations by group by. The data within each window can be sorted and grouped using the over() clause. The analytic function computes a single value for each row of the result set, rather than one value per group by grouping. This flexible approach allows the user to add additional columns to the select clause, giving the user more opportunities to reorganize and filter the result set. Analytic functions can only appear in select lists and in the outermost order by clause. During the query process, the analytical function will take effect at the end, that is, after the join, where and group by operations are performed. Analytical functions are often used in financial and scientific computing to analyze trends, calculate outliers, and perform bucket analysis on large amounts of data."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The syntax of the analytic function:"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-sql",children:"function(args) OVER(partition_by_clause order_by_clause [window_clause])    \npartition_by_clause ::= PARTITION BY expr [, expr ...]    \norder_by_clause ::= ORDER BY expr [ASC | DESC] [, expr [ASC | DESC] ...]\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"function",children:"Function"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Support Functions: AVG(), COUNT(), DENSE_RANK(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAG(), LAST_VALUE(), LEAD(), MAX(), MIN(), RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), SUM() and all aggregate functions"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"partition-by-clause",children:"PARTITION BY clause"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Partition By clause is similar to Group By.
