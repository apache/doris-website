Both Doris and Clickhouse support detailed data storage, but the capability for concurrency of Clickhouse is low. On the contrary, Doris supports high-concurrency and low-latency query services, and a single machine supports up to thousands of QPS. When the concurrency increases, horizontal expansion of FE and BE can be supported. However, Clickhouse's data import is not able to support Transaction SQL, which cannot realize Exactly-once semantics and has limited ablility for standard SQL. In contrast, Doris provides Transaction SQL and atomicity for data import. Doris itself can ensure that messages in Kafka are not lost or re-subscribed, which is to say, Exactly-Once semantics is supported. ClickHouse has high learning cost, high operation and maintenance costs, and weak in distribution. The fact that it requires more customization and deeper technical strength is another problem. Doris is different. There are only two core components, FE and BE, and there are fewer external dependencies.
