## 描述

判断两个文本之间的语义相似性

## 语法


```sql
LLM_LLM_SIMILARITY([<resource_name>], <text_1>, <text_2>)
```

## 参数

|    参数    | 说明 |
| ---------- | -------- |
| `<resource_name>`| 指定的资源名称|
| `<text_1>`   | 文本   |
| `<text_2>`   | 文本 |

## 返回值

返回一个 0 - 10 之间的浮点数。0 表示无相似性，10 表示强相似性。

当输入有值为 NULL 时返回 NULL

结果为大模型生成，所以返回内容并不固定

## 示例

假设我有如下表，代表某家快递公司收到的评论：
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_comments (
    id      INT,
    comment VARCHAR(500)
) DUPLICATE KEY(id)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES (
    "replication_num" = "1"
);
```

当我想按顾客语气情绪对评论进行排行时可以：
```sql
SELECT comment,
    LLM_SIMILARITY('resource_name', 'I am extremely dissatisfied with their service.', comment) AS score
FROM user_comments ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 5;
```

查询结果大致如下：
```text
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
| comment                                         | score |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
| It arrived broken and I am really disappointed. |   7.5 |
| Delivery was very slow and frustrating.         |   6.5 |
| Not bad, but the packaging could be better.     |   3.5 |
| It is fine, nothing special to mention.         |     3 |
| Absolutely fantastic, highly recommend it.      |     1 |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
