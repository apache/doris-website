You can view help and examples with the three commands `HELP STOP ROUTINE LOAD;`, `HELP PAUSE ROUTINE LOAD;` and `HELP RESUME ROUTINE LOAD;`.\n\n## other instructions\n\n1. The relationship between a routine load job and an ALTER TABLE operation\n\n    * Routine load does not block SCHEMA CHANGE and ROLLUP operations. Note, however, that if the column mappings are not matched after SCHEMA CHANGE is completed, the job\'s erroneous data will spike and eventually cause the job to pause. It is recommended to reduce this type of problem by explicitly specifying column mappings in routine load jobs and by adding Nullable columns or columns with Default values.\n    * Deleting a Partition of a table may cause the loaded data to fail to find the corresponding Partition and the job will be paused.\n\n2. Relationship between routine load jobs and other load jobs (LOAD, DELETE, INSERT)\n\n    * Routine load does not conflict with other LOAD jobs and INSERT operations.\n    * When performing a DELETE operation, the corresponding table partition cannot have any load tasks being executed. Therefore, before performing the DELETE operation, you may need to pause the routine load job and wait for the delivered task to complete before you can execute DELETE.\n\n3. Relationship between routine load jobs and DROP DATABASE/TABLE operations\n\n    When the corresponding database or table is deleted, the job will automatically CANCEL.\n\n4. The relationship between the kafka type routine load job and kafka topic\n\n    When the user creates a routine load declaration, the `kafka_topic` does not exist in the kafka cluster.\n\n    * If the broker of the user kafka cluster has `auto.create.topics.enable = true` set, `kafka_topic` will be automatically created first, and the number of partitions created automatically will be in the kafka cluster** of the user side. The broker is configured with `num.partitions`. The routine job will continue to read the data of the topic continuously.\n    * If the broker of the user kafka cluster has `auto.create.topics.enable = false` set, topic will not be created automatically, and the routine will be paused before any data is read, with the status `PAUSED`.\n\n    So, if the user wants to be automatically created by the routine when the kafka topic does not exist, just set the broker in the kafka cluster** of the user\'s side to set auto.create.topics.enable = true` .\n\n## Related parameters\n\nSome system configuration parameters can affect the use of routine loads.\n\n1. max\\_routine\\_load\\_task\\_concurrent\\_num\n\n    The FE configuration item, which defaults to 5, can be modified at runtime. This parameter limits the maximum number of subtask concurrency for a routine load job. It is recommended to maintain the default value. If the setting is too large, it may cause too many concurrent tasks and occupy cluster resources.\n\n2. max\\_routine_load\\_task\\_num\\_per\\_be\n\n    The FE configuration item, which defaults to 5, can be modified at runtime. This parameter limits the number of subtasks that can be executed concurrently by each BE node. It is recommended to maintain the default value. If the setting is too large, it may cause too many concurrent tasks and occupy cluster resources.\n\n3. max\\_routine\\_load\\_job\\_num\n    \n    The FE configuration item, which defaults to 100, can be modified at runtime. This parameter limits the total number of routine load jobs, including NEED_SCHEDULED, RUNNING, PAUSE. After the overtime, you cannot submit a new assignment.\n\n4. max\\_consumer\\_num\\_per\\_group\n\n    BE configuration item, the default is 3. This parameter indicates that up to several consumers are generated in a subtask for data consumption. For a Kafka data source, a consumer may consume one or more kafka partitions. Suppose a task needs to consume 6 kafka partitions, it will generate 3 consumers, and each consumer consumes 2 partitions. If there are only 2 partitions, only 2 consumers will be generated, and each consumer will consume 1 partition.\n\n5. push\\_write\\_mbytes\\_per\\_sec\n\n    BE configuration item. The default is 10, which is 10MB/s. This parameter is to load common parameters, not limited to routine load jobs. This parameter limits the speed at which loaded data is written to disk. For high-performance storage devices such as SSDs, this speed limit can be appropriately increased.\n')])])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
