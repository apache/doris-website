## Behavior changes

SQL input is treated as multiple statements only when the `CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS` setting is enabled on the client side, enhancing compatibility with MySQL. [#36759](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36759)

## New features

- A new BE configuration `allow_zero_date` has been added, allowing dates with all zeros. When set to `false`, `0000-00-00` is parsed as `NULL`, and when set to `true`, it is parsed as `0000-01-01`. The default value is `false` to maintain consistency with previous behavior. [#34961](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/34961)


- `LogicalWindow` and `LogicalPartitionTopN` support multi-field predicate pushdown to improve performance. [#36828](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36828)


- The ES Catalog now maps ES `nested` or `object` types to Doris `JSON` types. [#37101](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37101)


## Improvements

- Queries with `LIMIT` end reading data earlier to reduce resource consumption and improve performance. [#36535](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36535)


- Special JSON data with empty keys is now supported. [#36762](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36762)


- Stability and usability of routine load have been improved, including load balancing, automatic recovery, exception handling, and more user-friendly error messages. [#36450](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36450) [#35376](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35376) [#35266](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35266) [ #33372](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/33372) [#32282](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/32282) [#32046](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/32046) [#32021](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/32021) [#31846](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/31846) [#31273](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/31273)


- BE load balancing selection of hard disk strategy and speed optimization. [#36826](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36826) [#36795](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36795) [#36509](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36509)


- Stability and usability of the JDBC catalog have been improved, including encryption, thread pool connection count configuration, and more user-friendly error messages. [#36940](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36940) [#36720](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36720) [#30880](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/30880) [#35692](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35692)
