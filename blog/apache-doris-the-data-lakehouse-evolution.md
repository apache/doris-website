    'title': 'The data lakehouse evolution: why Apache Doris is leading the way',
    'summary': "As enterprises push forward with building a lakehouse architecture, they often face complex challenges. Apache Doris aims to facilitate this process. It offers easy data access (from Hive, Iceberg, Hudi, Paimon), an extensible connector framework (with Kudu, BigQuery, Delta Lake, Kafka, and Redis) and convenient cross-source data processing with high analytics performance. It also allows easy deployment, a rich set of data storage and management capabilities, and strong support for open table formats and file formats.",
