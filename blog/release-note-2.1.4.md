Dear community, Apache Doris version 2.1.4 was released on June 26, 2024. In this update, we have optimized various functional experiences for data lakehouse scenarios, with a focus on resolving the abnormal memory usage issue in the previous version. Additionally, we have implemented several improvemnents and bug fixes to enhance the stability.  Welcome to download and use it.

**Quick Download:** https://doris.apache.org/download/

**GitHub Release:** https://github.com/apache/doris/releases

## Behavior changes

- Non-existent files will be ignored when querying external tables such as Hive. [#35319](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35319)

  The file list is obtained from the meta cache, and it may not be consistent with the actual file list.

  Ignoring non-existent files helps to avoid query errors.

- By default, creating a Bitmap Index will no longer be automatically changed to an Inverted Index. [#35521](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35521)

  This behavior is controlled by the FE configuration item `enable_create_bitmap_index_as_inverted_index`, which defaults to false.

- When starting FE and BE processes using `--console`, all logs will be output to the standard output and differentiated by prefixes indicating the log type. [#35679](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35679)

  For more infomation, please see the documentations:

  - [Log Management - FE Log](https://doris.apache.org/docs/admin-manual/log-management/fe-log)

  - [Log Management - BE Log](https://doris.apache.org/docs/admin-manual/log-management/be-log)

- If no table comment is provided when creating a table, the default comment will be empty instead of using the table type as the default comment. [#36025](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36025)

- The default precision of DECIMALV3 has been adjusted from (9, 0) to (38, 9) to maintain compatibility with the version in which this feature was initially released. [#36316](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36316)
