Dear Community, **Apache Doris version 2.1.8 was officially released on January 24, 2025.** This version introduces continuous upgrades and enhancements in several key areas, including Lakehouse, Asynchronous Materialized Views, Query Optimizer and Execution Engine, Storage Management, and more.

- [Quick Download](https://doris.apache.org/download)

- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/apache/doris/releases/tag/2.1.8-rc01)

## Behavior Changes

- Add the environment variable `SKIP_CHECK_ULIMIT` to skip the ulimit value verification check within the BE process. This is only available to applications in the Docker quick start scenario. [#45267](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/45267)
- Add the `enable_cooldown_replica_affinity` session variable to control the selection of replica affinity for queries under cold - hot separation.
- In FE, add the configurations `restore_job_compressed_serialization` and `backup_job_compressed_serialization` to solve the OOM problem of FE during backup and restore operations when the number of db tablets is extremely large. By default, these configurations are disabled, and once enabled, they cannot be downgraded.

## New Features

- The Arrow flight protocol supports accessing BE through a load - balancing device. [#43281](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/43281)
- Now lambda expressions support capturing external columns (#45186).[#45186](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/45186)

## Improvements

### Lakehouse

- Update the Hudi version to 0.15. And optimize the query planning performance of Hudi tables.
- Optimize the read performance of MaxCompute partitioned tables. [#45148](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/45148)
- Support the session variable `enable_text_validate_utf8`, which can ignore the UTF8 encoding detection in CSV format. [#45537](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/45537)
- Optimize the performance of Parquet file lazy materialization under high - filtering - rate conditions. [#46183](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/46183)

### Asynchronous Materialized Views

- Now it supports manually refreshing partitions that do not exist in an asynchronous materialized view [#45290](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/45290).
- Optimize the performance of transparent rewrite planning [#44786](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/44786).

### Query Optimizer

- Improve the adaptive ability of runtime filters [#42640](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/42640).
- Add the ability to generate original column filter conditions from filter conditions on `max/min` aggregate function columns [#39252](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/39252)
- Add the ability to extract single - side filter conditions from join predicates [#38479](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/38479).
- Optimize the ability of predicate derivation on set operators to better generate filter predicates [#39450](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/39450).
- Optimize the exception handling ability of statistic information collection and usage to avoid generating unexpected execution plans when collection exceptions occur. [#43009](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/43009) [#43776](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/43776) [#43865](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/43865) [#42104](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/42104) [#42399](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/42399) [#41729](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/41729)

### Query Execution Engine

- Optimize the execution of queries with `limit` to end faster and avoid unnecessary data scanning [#44255](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/44255).

### Storage Management

- CCR supports more comprehensive operations, such as `rename table`, `rename column`, `modify comment`, `drop view`, `drop rollup`, etc.
- Improve the accuracy of the broker load import progress and the performance when importing multiple compressed files.
- Improve the routine load timeout strategy and thread - pool usage to prevent routine load timeout failures and impacts on queries.

### Others

- The Docker quick - start image supports starting without setting environment parameters. Add the environment variable `SKIP_CHECK_ULIMIT` to skip the `start_be.sh` script and the swap, `max_map_count`, ulimit - related verification checks within the BE process. This is only applicable to applications in the Docker quick - start scenario.  [#45269](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/45269)

- Now, the default values of columns can be correctly displayed in the `COLUMNS` system table. [#44849](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/44849)
- Now, the definition of views can be correctly displayed in the `VIEWS` system table. [#45857](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/45857)
- Now, the `admin` user cannot be deleted. [#44751](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/44751)
