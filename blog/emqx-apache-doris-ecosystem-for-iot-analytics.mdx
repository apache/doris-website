    'title': 'EMQX now supports real-time data ingestion into Apache Doris for efficient IoT analytics'
    'summary': "Apache Doris data integration is an out-of-the-box feature in EMQX, which enables complex business development through simple configuration. In a typical IoT application, EMQX, as the IoT platform, is responsible for device connection and transmitting messages. Apache Doris, as the data storage platform, is responsible for storing device status and metadata, as well as message data storage and data analysis. Using EMQX and Apache Doris, users can build high-performance, reliable, and scalable IoT applications that deliver an end-to-end solution from data acquisition through analytics to actionable intelligence."
