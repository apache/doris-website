```sql
ADMIN SHOW CONFIG -> SHOW CONFIG
ADMIN SHOW REPLICA -> SHOW REPLICA
ADMIN DIAGNOSE TABLET -> SHOW TABLET DIAGNOSIS
ADMIN SHOW TABLET -> SHOW TABLET
```

## Improvement

- Limit the max string length to 1024 while collecting column stats to control BE memory usage

- JDBC Catalog close when JDBC client is not empty

- Accept all Iceberg database and do not check the name format of database

- Refresh external table's rowcount async to avoid cache miss and unstable query plan

- Simplify the isSplitable method of hive external table to avoid too many hadoop metrics
