**Apache Doris version 2.1.5 was officially released on July 24, 2024.** In this update, we have optimized various functional experiences for data lakehouse and high concurrency scenarios, functionalities of asynchronous materialized views. Additionaly, we have implemented several improvemnents and bug fixes to enhance the stability. 

**Quick Download:** https://doris.apache.org/download/

**GitHub Release:** https://github.com/apache/doris/releases

## Behavior changes

- The default connection pool size for the JDBC Catalog has been increased from 10 to 30 to prevent connection exhaustion in high-concurrency scenarios. [#37023](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37023). 

- The system's reserved memory (low water mark) has been adjusted to `min(6.4GB, MemTotal * 5%)` to mitigate BE OOM issues.

- When processing multiple statements in a single request, only the last statement's result is returned if the `CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS` flag is not set.

- Direct modifications to data in asynchronous materialized views are no longer permitted.[#37129](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37129)

- A session variable `use_max_length_of_varchar_in_ctas` has been added to control the behavior of varchar and char type length generation during CTAS (Create Table As Select). The default value is true. When set to false, the derived varchar length is used instead of the maximum length. [#37284](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37284)

- Statistics collection now defaults to enabling the functionality of estimating the number of rows in Hive tables based on file size. [#37694](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37694)

- Transparent rewrite for asynchronous materialized views is now enabled by default. [#35897](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35897)

- Transparent rewrite utilizes partitioned materialized views. If partitions fail, the base tables are unioned with the materialized view to ensure data correctness. [#35897](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35897)

## New features

### Lakehouse

- The session variable `read_csv_empty_line_as_null` can be used to control whether empty lines are ignored when reading CSV format files. [#37153](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37153) 

  By default, empty lines are ignored. When set to true, empty lines will be read as rows where all columns are null.

- Compatibility with Presto's complex type output format can be enabled by setting `serde_dialect="presto"`. [#37253](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37253)

### Multi-Table Materialized View

- Supports non-deterministic functions in materialized view building. [#37651](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37651)

- Atomically replaces definitions of asynchronous materialized views. [#37147](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37147)

- Views creation statements can be viewed via `SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`. [#37125](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37125)

- Transparent rewrites for multi-dimensional aggregation and non-aggregate queries. [#37436](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37436) [#37497](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37497)

- Supports DISTINCT aggregations with key columns and partitioning for roll-ups. [#37651](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37651)  

- Support for partitioning materialized views to roll up partitions using `date_trunc` [#31812](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/31812) [#35562](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/35562)

- Partitioned table-valued functions (TVFs) are supported. [#36479](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36479)

### Semi-Structured Data Management

- Tables using the VARIANT type now support partial column updates. [#34925](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/34925)

- PreparedStatement support is now enabled by default. [#36581](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36581)

- The VARIANT type can be exported to CSV format. [#37857](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37857)

- `explode_json_object` function transposes JSON Object rows into columns. [#36887](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36887)

- The ES Catalog now maps ES NESTED or OBJECT types to the Doris JSON type.[#37101](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37101)

- By default, support_phrase is enabled for inverted indexes with specified analyzers to improve the performance of match_phrase series queries. [#37949](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37949)

### Query Optimizer

- Support for explaining `DELETE FROM` statements. [#37100](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37100)

- Support for hint form of constant expression parameters [#37988](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37988)

### Memory Management

## Improvements

### Lakehouse

- Upgraded Paimon to version 0.8.1

- Fixes ClassNotFoundException for org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils when querying Paimon tables. [#37512](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37512)

- Added support for Tencent Cloud LakeFS. [#36891](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36891)

- Optimized the timeout duration when fetching file lists for external table queries. [#36842](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36842)

- Improved default connection logic for SQLServer JDBC Catalog. [#36971](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/36971)

  By default, the connection encryption settings are not intervened. Only when `force_sqlserver_jdbc_encrypt_false` is set to true, encrypt=false is forcibly added to the JDBC URL to reduce authentication errors. This allows for more flexible control over encryption behavior, enabling it to be turned on or off as needed.

- Added serde properties to the show create table statements for Hive tables. [#37096](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37096)

- Changed the default cache time for Hive table lists on the FE from 1 day to 4 hours

- Data export (Export/Outfile) now supports specifying compression formats for Parquet and ORC

  For more information, please refer to [docs](https://doris.apache.org/docs/sql-manual/sql-statements/Data-Manipulation-Statements/Manipulation/EXPORT/?_highlight=compress_type).

- When creating a table using CTAS+TVF, partition columns in the TVF are automatically mapped to Varchar(65533) instead of String, allowing them to be used as partition columns for internal tables [#37161](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37161)

- Optimized the number of metadata accesses for Hive write operations [#37127](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37127)

- ES Catalog now supports mapping nested/object types to Doris's Json type. [#37182](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37182)

- Improved error messages when connecting to Oracle using older versions of the ojdbc driver [#37634](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37634)

- When Hudi tables return an empty set during Incremental Read, Doris now also returns an empty set instead of error [#37636](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37636)

- Fixed an issue where inner-outer table join queries could lead to FE timeouts in some cases [#37757](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/37757)
