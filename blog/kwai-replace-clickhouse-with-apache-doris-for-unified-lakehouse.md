    'summary': "Kwai, a leading social media platform, has replaced ClickHouse with Apache Doris to upgrade its OLAP system, now handling nearly 1 billion daily queries. This move shifts them from a complex lake-warehouse separation model to a unified lakehouse architecture. The new system leverages Doris's direct lake access and an intelligent auto-materialization service to solve critical issues of data redundancy, resource contention, and complex governance.",
