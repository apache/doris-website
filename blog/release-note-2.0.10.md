## Improvements

- This enhancement introduces the `read_only` and `super_read_only` variables to the database system, ensuring compatibility with MySQL's read-only modes.

- When the check status is not IO_ERROR, the disk path should not be added to the broken list. This ensures that only disks with actual I/O errors are marked as broken.

- When performing a Create Table As Select (CTAS) operation from an external table, convert the `VARCHAR` column to `STRING` type.

- Support mapping Paimon column type "ROW" to Doris type "STRUCT"

- Choose disk tolerate with little skew when creating tablet

- Write editlog to `set replica drop` to avoid confusing status on follower FE

- Make the schema change memory space adaptive to avoid memory over limit

- Inverted index 'unicode' tokenizer supports configuration to exclude stop words
