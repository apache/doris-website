- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/apache/doris/releases/tag/2.1.10-rc01)



## Behavior Changes

- DELETE no longer incorrectly requires the SELECT_PRIV permission on the target table. [ #49794](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/49794)
- Insert Overwrite no longer restricts concurrent operations on the same table to 1. [ #48673](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/48673)
- Merge on write unique tables prohibit the use of time-series compaction. [ #49905](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/49905)
- Building indexes on VARIANT type columns is prohibited. [ #49159](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/49159)
