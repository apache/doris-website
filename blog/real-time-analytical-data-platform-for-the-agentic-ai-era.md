    'title': 'Apache Doris + MCP: The Real-Time Analytical Data Platform for the Agentic AI Era',
    'summary': "Apache Doris is built to meet the data challenges in the agentic AI era, delivering real-time analytics at scale. But to use Doris's power for AI agents, you need a bridge between them. That's where Doris MCP Server comes in, acting as a communication layer between AI agents and Doris.In this article, we'll explore how agentic AI is rewriting the rules for analytics, how MCP connects AI agents to data sources, and walk through two demos that bring AI agents, MCP, and Apache Doris together in action.",
