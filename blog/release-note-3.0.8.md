## Behavior Changes

- When using ranger / LDAP, creating users in Doris is no longer prohibited [#50139](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/50139)
- The `nested` attribute of `variant` is disabled by default. To enable it when creating a table, you need to first execute the following command in the session variable: `set enable_variant_flatten_nested = true` [#54413](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/54413)

## New Features

### Query Optimizer

- Support MySQL's `GROUP BY WITH ORDER` syntax [#53037](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/53037)

## Improvements

### Data Ingestion

- Optimize the flushing strategy when memory is insufficient ([#52906](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/52906), [#53909](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/53909), [#42649](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/42649), [#54517](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/54517))
- S3 Load and TVF support accessing publicly readable objects without AK/SK ([#53592](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/53592), [#54040](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/54040))


### Storage-Compute Decoupled

- When the cache space is sufficient, the rowset generated by base compaction can be written to the file cache ([#53801](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/53801), [#54693](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/54693))
- Optimize the `ALTER STORAGE VAULT` command, the `type` attribute can be automatically inferred without explicit specification ([#54394](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/54394), [#54475](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/54475))


### Query Optimizer

- Point queries will be planned to have only one fragment to improve the execution speed of point queries [#53541](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/53541)

### Query Execution

- Improve the performance of unique key tables in point queries [#53948](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/53948)

### Inverted Index

- Optimize the additional resource consumption of common default tokenizers when writing non-tokenized indexes [#54666](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/54666)
