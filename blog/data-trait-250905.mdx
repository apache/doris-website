    'title': 'Data Traits in Apache Doris: The Secret Weapon Behind 2x Faster Performance'
    'summary': "At the core of database systems, the query optimizer acts as a shrewd strategist, constantly analyzing data traits to devise the optimal execution plans. Apache Doris, a high-performance MPP analytical database, employs a built-in Data Trait analysis mechanism in its optimizer. By uncovering statistical traits and semantic constraints within the data, Data Trait provides fundamental support for query optimization. Let’s explore its power!"
