# Compile on MacOS

This guide is about how to compile Doris on MacOS.

:::tip

Currently, this is not supported in the compute-storage decoupled mode.

:::

## Prerequisites

- MacOS 12 (Monterey) or later (Both **Intel** and **Apple Silicon** are supported.)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## Compile source code

1. **Install dependencies using** **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**

```Shell
brew install automake autoconf libtool pkg-config texinfo coreutils gnu-getopt \
python@3 cmake ninja ccache bison byacc gettext wget pcre maven llvm@16 openjdk@11 npm
```

:::tip 
On MacOS, since Homebrew does not provide an installation package for JDK8, JDK11 is used here instead. Alternatively, you can manually download and install JDK8. 
:::

2. **Compile source code**

```Shell
bash build.sh
```

:::tip 
The first step of compiling Doris is to download and compile third-party libraries. You can download the pre-compiled versions of third-party libraries provided by the Doris community. Please refer to the instructions below for downloading **pre-compiled third-party libraries** to speed up the build process. 
:::

## Start

1. **Increase file descriptors limit**

```Shell
# Increase the file descriptor limit using the ulimit command.
ulimit -n 65536

# Check if the change is effective.
$ ulimit -n

# Add the configuration to your startup script so that you do not have to set it again every time you open a new terminal session.
# If you are using bash, execute the following statement:
echo 'ulimit -n 65536' >>~/.bashrc
# If you are using zsh, execute the following statement:
echo 'ulimit -n 65536' >>~/.zshrc
```

2. **Start BE**

```Shell
cd output/be/bin
./start_be.sh --daemon
```

3. **Start** **FE**

```Shell
cd output/fe/bin
./start_fe.sh --daemon
```

## Speed up by using pre-compiled third-party libraries

Download the pre-compiled third-party libraries from [Apache Doris Third Party Prebuilt](https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/tag/automation). Refer to the command below: 

```shell
cd thirdparty
rm -rf installed

# Intel chip
curl -L https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/download/automation/doris-thirdparty-prebuilt-darwin-x86_64.tar.xz \
    -o - | tar -Jxf -

# Apple Silicon chip
curl -L https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/download/automation/doris-thirdparty-prebuilt-darwin-arm64.tar.xz \
    -o - | tar -Jxf -

# Check if protoc and thrift functions normally
cd installed/bin

./protoc --version
./thrift --version
```

:::tip 
When running protoc and thrift, you may encounter an issue where the binary cannot be opened due to developer verification. To resolve this, you can go to "Security & Privacy" settings. In the "General" tab, click on the "Open Anyway" button to confirm your intent to open the binary. Refer to: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445 
:::

## Common Errors
1. When running `protoc` and `thrift`, you may encounter an issue where the binary cannot be opened due to developer verification. To resolve this, you can go to "Security & Privacy" settings. In the "General" tab, click on the "Open Anyway" button to confirm your intent to open the binary. Refer to: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445.
2. When compiling with a Mac with an M3 chip, the compilation of the proto file fails.
The failure log is as follows:
```Shell
[ERROR] ... [0:0]: --grpc-java_out: protoc-gen-grpc-java: Plugin failed with status code 1.
```
The reason for this error may be that the Apple arm-based chip does not support software on the x86 platform. 
You can download the protoc-gen-grpc-java software used from https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/grpc/protoc-gen-grpc-java/, and the version information can be viewed from the grpc.java.artifact property under the protoc_rosetta profile in fe/fe-core/pom.xml. If the following error is reported after downloading and executing, it means that the current Mac cannot execute software based on x86 compiled software.
```Shell
zsh: bad CPU type in executable:./protoc-gen-grpc-java-1.34.0-osx-x86_64.exe
```
You can refer to the official documentation https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527 and install `Rosetta` to solve this problem.
