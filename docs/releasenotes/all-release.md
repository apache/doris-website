This document presents a summary of Apache Doris versions released within one year, listed in reverse chronological order.

:::tip Latest Release
🎉 Version 4.0.3 is released. Check out the 🔗[Release Notes](../releasenotes/v4.0/release-4.0.3) here. Apache Doris 4.0 takes a major step forward with new AI support (vector search, AI Functions) and better full-text search capabilities. These upgrades help users stay ahead in the AI and agent era, enabling companies to handle everything from traditional BI analysis to AI-driven workloads.

<br />

🎉 Version 3.1.4 is released. Check out the 🔗[Release Notes](../releasenotes/v3.1/release-3.1.4) here. Doris 3.1 introduces a sparse column and schema template for the VARIANT data type, making it more efficient to store and query large datasets with dynamic fields, such as logs and JSON data. For lakehouse capabilities, it enhances asynchronous materialized views and expands support for Iceberg and Paimon to build a stronger bridge between data lakes and data warehouses.

<br />

🎉 Version 3.0.8 released now. Check out the 🔗[Release Notes](../releasenotes/v3.0/release-3.0.8) here. Starting from version 3.X, Apache Doris supports a compute-storage decoupled mode in addition to the compute-storage coupled mode for cluster deployment. With the cloud-native architecture that decouples the computation and storage layers, users can achieve physical isolation between query loads across multiple compute clusters, as well as isolation between read and write loads. 

<br />

🎉 Version 2.1.11 released now. Check out the 🔗[Release Notes](../releasenotes/v2.1/release-2.1.11) here. The 2.1 version delivers exceptional performance with 100% higher out-of-the-box queries proven by TPC-DS 1TB tests, enhanced data lake analytics that are 4-6 times speedier than Trino and Spark, solid support for semi-structured data analysis with new Variant types and suite of analytical functions, asynchronous materialized views for query acceleration, optimized real-time writing at scale, and better workload management with stability and runtime SQL resource tracking.
