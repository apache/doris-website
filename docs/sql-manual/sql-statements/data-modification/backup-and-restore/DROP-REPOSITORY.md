## Description

This statement is used to delete a created repository.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP REPOSITORY <repo_name>;
```

## Required Parameters
**<repo_name>**
> The unique name of the repository.

## Access Control Requirements

| Privilege               | Object                         | Notes                                               |

## Usage notes
- Deleting the repository only removes its mapping in Doris and does not delete the actual repository data. After deletion, the repository can be mapped again by specifying the same LOCATION.

## Examples

Delete the repository named example_repo:

```sql
DROP REPOSITORY `example_repo`;
```
