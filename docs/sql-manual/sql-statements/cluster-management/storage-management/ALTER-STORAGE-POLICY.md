## Description

This statement is used to modify an existing hot-cold tiered migration policy. Only root or admin users can modify resources.

## Syntax
```sql
ALTER STORAGE POLICY  '<policy_name>' PROPERTIE ("<key>"="<value>"[, ... ]);
```

## Required Parameters


1.`<policy_name>`  
> The name of the storage policy. This is the unique identifier of the storage policy you want to modify, and an existing policy name must be specified. 

## Optional Parameters
`PROPERTIE ("<key>"="<value>"[, ... ])` 

1.`retention_days`  
> Data retention period. Defines the duration for which the data is kept in storage. Data exceeding this period will be automatically deleted. 

2.`redundancy_level`
> Redundancy level. Defines the number of data replicas to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. For example, a value of 2 means each data block has two replicas. 

3.`storage_type`   
> Storage type. Specifies the storage medium used, such as SSD, HDD, or hybrid storage. This affects performance and cost. 

4.`cooloff_time`    
> Cool-off time. The time interval between when data is marked for deletion and when it is actually deleted. This helps prevent data loss due to accidental operations. 

5.`location_policy` 
> Geographical location policy. Defines the geographical placement of data, such as cross-region replication for disaster recovery. 

## Examples

1. Modify the cooldown_datetime for hot-cold tiered data migration:
```sql
ALTER STORAGE POLICY has_test_policy_to_alter PROPERTIES("cooldown_datetime" = "2023-06-08 00:00:00");
```
2. Modify the cooldown_ttl for hot-cold tiered data migration countdown:

```sql
ALTER STORAGE POLICY has_test_policy_to_alter PROPERTIES ("cooldown_ttl" = "10000");
```
```sql
ALTER STORAGE POLICY has_test_policy_to_alter PROPERTIES ("cooldown_ttl" = "1h");
```
```sql
ALTER STORAGE POLICY has_test_policy_to_alter PROPERTIES ("cooldown_ttl" = "3d");
```
