## Description


This statement is used to display the hotspot information of the file cache.

:::info Note

Before version 3.0.4, you could use the `SHOW CACHE HOTSPOT` statement to query cache hotspot information statistics. Starting from version 3.0.4, the use of the `SHOW CACHE HOTSPOT` statement for cache hotspot information statistics is no longer supported. Please directly access the system table `__internal_schema.cloud_cache_hotspot` for queries. For detailed usage, refer to [MANAGING FILE CACHE](../../../../compute-storage-decoupled/file-cache). 



## Syntax


```sql
   SHOW CACHE HOTSPOT '/[<compute_group_name>/<table_name>]';
```

## Parameters


| Parameter Name	                  | Description                                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <compute_group_name>        | The name of the compute group.                                               |

## Examples

1. Display cache hot spot information for the entire system:

```sql
SHOW CACHE HOTSPOT '/';
```

2. Display cache hot spot information for a specific compute group my_compute_group:

```sql
SHOW CACHE HOTSPOT '/my_compute_group/';
```
