## ALTER-SYSTEM-RENAME-COMPUTE-GROUP


### Name

ALTER SYSTEM RENAME COMPUTE-GROUP

### Description

Used for renaming compute groups (admin use only!)

grammar:

- In a separation of storage and computing cluster, this statement is used to rename an existing compute group. This operation is synchronous, and the command returns once the execution is complete.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM RENAME COMPUTE GROUP <old_name> <new_name>
```


Notes:
1. The naming rules for compute groups are consistent with the naming rules for database and table names in DORIS.
2. All compute groups in the current separation of storage and computing cluster can be viewed using [SHOW COMPUTE GROUPS](../compute-management/SHOW-COMPUTE-GROUPS)。
3. After the renaming operation is completed, it can also be confirmed by using [SHOW COMPUTE GROUPS](../compute-management/SHOW-COMPUTE-GROUPS)。
4. If the renaming operation fails, you can check the returned message for reasons, such as the original compute group not existing or the original and target compute group names being the same.

### Example

1. Rename the compute group named old_name to new_name.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM RENAME COMPUTE GROUP <old_name> <new_name>
```

### Keywords

ALTER, SYSTEM, RENAME, ALTER SYSTEM
