## Access Control Requirements

The user who executes this SQL must have at least the following permissions:

| Privilege  | Object | Notes |
|------------|----|----|
| ADMIN_PRIV |    |    |

## Usage Notes

If you need to further filter the query results, you can use the table-valued function [frontends()](../../../sql-functions/table-valued-functions/frontends.md). SHOW FRONTENDS is equivalent to the following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM FRONTENDS();
```

## Examples

```sql
SHOW FRONTENDS
```
