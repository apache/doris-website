STRUCT type is used to store and process structured data, which can contain fields of different types, each with a name and corresponding value. STRUCT can nest other complex types such as ARRAY, MAP, or other STRUCTs.

## Cast to STRUCT

### FROM String

#### Strict Mode

##### BNF Definition

```xml
<struct>          ::= "{" <struct-content>? "}" | <empty-struct> 

<empty-struct> ::= "{}"

<struct-content>  ::=  <struct-field-value-content> | <struct-only-value-content>

<struct-field-value-content> ::=  <field-token> <map_key_delimiter> <value-token>
                     (<collection-delim> <field-token> <map_key_delimiter> <value-token>)*
                         
<struct-only-value-content> ::=  <value-token>(<collection-delim> <value-token>)*

<value-token>    ::= <whitespace>* "\"" <inner-sequence> "\"" <whitespace>*
                   | <whitespace>* "'" <inner-sequence> "'" <whitespace>*
                   | <whitespace>* <inner-sequence> <whitespace>*

<inner-sequence>    ::= .*
<collection-delim>  ::= "," 
<map_key_delimiter> ::= ":"
```

##### Rule Description

1. The textual representation of a STRUCT must begin with a left brace `{` and end with a right brace `}`.
2. Empty STRUCTs are directly represented as `{}`.
3. Field-value pairs within the STRUCT are separated by commas `,`.
4. Each field-value pair consists of an optional field name, a colon `:`, and a value, in the order "fieldname:value" or simply "value".
5. Field-value pairs must either all use the "fieldname:value" format or all use the "value" format.
6. Field names and values can optionally be enclosed in matching single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). The content inside the quotes is treated as a single entity.
7. Whitespace is allowed before and after elements within the STRUCT.
8. During parsing, parts that match `<value-token>` continue to apply the parsing rules of the value type. If there are `<field-token>` parts, they must match the number and order of names defined in the STRUCT.
9. Elements can use "null" to represent a null value.

If the STRUCT format does not meet the requirements, an error is reported, for example:
1. The number of field-value pairs does not match the number defined in the STRUCT.
2. The order of field-values does not match the order defined in the STRUCT.
3. Some field-value pairs have field names while others do not (they must either all have field names or none have field names).

If a value in the STRUCT does not meet the requirements of the corresponding type, an error is reported.

If a value in the STRUCT does not meet the requirements of the corresponding type, the corresponding position is set to null.

### FROM STRUCT\<Other Type\>

When the source data is of STRUCT type and the target is also of STRUCT type, the following conditions must be met:

1. The source STRUCT and target STRUCT must have the same number of elements (fields)
2. Each element in the source STRUCT will be converted to the corresponding element type in the target STRUCT in sequence

If the above conditions are not met, such as when the number of elements doesn't match, the conversion will not be possible.

#### Strict Mode

##### Rule Description

For each element in the STRUCT, a Cast from Other Type To Type is performed. The Cast is also in strict mode.

##### Examples

```sql
-- Create a simple STRUCT type variable
mysql> SELECT named_struct('a', 123, 'b', 'abc') AS original_struct;
+----------------------+

+------------------------+

#### Non-Strict Mode

##### Rule Description

For each element in the STRUCT, a Cast from Other Type To Type is performed. The Cast is also in non-strict mode.
