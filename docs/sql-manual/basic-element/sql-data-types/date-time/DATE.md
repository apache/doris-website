## Description

DATE type stores dates, with a value range of `[0000-01-01, 9999-12-31]`, and the default output format is 'yyyy-MM-dd'.

Doris uses the Gregorian calendar date format, and the dates existing in the Gregorian calendar correspond one by one to the dates existing in Doris, where `0000` represents 1 BC (BCE 1).

DATE type can be used as a primary key, partition column or bucket column. A DATE type field actually occupies 4 bytes in Doris. DATE is stored separately by year、month、day in runtime, so executing `months_add` operation on DATE column is more efficient than `unix_timestamp`.

How to convert other types to DATE, and the input accepted during conversion, see [Cast to DATE](../conversion/date-conversion.md).

Date and time types do not support direct use of mathematical operators for arithmetic operations. The essence of performing mathematical operations is to first implicitly convert the date and time types to numeric types, and then perform the operation. If you need to perform addition, subtraction, or rounding on time types, consider using functions like [DATE_ADD](../../../sql-functions/scalar-functions/date-time-functions/date-add.md), [DATE_SUB](../../../sql-functions/scalar-functions/date-time-functions/date-sub.md), [TIMESTAMPDIFF](../../../sql-functions/scalar-functions/date-time-functions/timestampdiff.md), [DATE_TRUNC](../../../sql-functions/scalar-functions/date-time-functions/date-trunc.md).

TIME type does not store time zone, that is, changes in the session variable `time_zone` do not affect the stored values of TIME type.

## Examples

```sql
select cast('2020-01-02' as date);
```

```text
+----------------------------+
| cast('2020-01-02' as date) |
+----------------------------+
| 2020-01-02                 |
+----------------------------+
```

```sql
select cast('0120-02-29' as date);
```

```text
+----------------------------+
| cast('0120-02-29' as date) |
+----------------------------+
| 0120-02-29                 |
+----------------------------+
```
