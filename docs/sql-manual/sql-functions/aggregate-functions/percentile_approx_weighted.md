## Description

The `PERCENTILE_APPROX_WEIGHTED` function calculates weighted approximate percentiles, primarily used in scenarios where value importance needs to be considered. It is a weighted version of `PERCENTILE_APPROX`, allowing a weight to be specified for each value.

Key features:
1. Weight Support: Each value can be assigned a corresponding weight, affecting the final percentile calculation
2. Memory Efficiency: Uses fixed-size memory, suitable for processing large-scale data
3. Adjustable Precision: Balance between precision and performance through the compression parameter

## Syntax

```sql
PERCENTILE_APPROX_WEIGHTED(<col>, <weight>, <p> [, <compression>])
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `<col>` | The column to calculate the percentile for |
| `<weight>` | Weight column, must be positive numbers |
| `<p>` | Percentile value, range `[0.0, 1.0]`, e.g., `0.99` represents the `99`th percentile |
| `<compression>` | Optional parameter, compression ratio, range `[2048, 10000]`. The higher the value, the higher the precision, but the greater the memory consumption. If not specified or outside the range, use `10000`. |

## Return Value

Return a `DOUBLE` type value, representing the calculated weighted approximate percentile.

## Examples

```sql
-- Create sample table
CREATE TABLE weighted_scores (
    student_id INT,
    score DECIMAL(10, 2),
    weight INT
) DUPLICATE KEY(student_id)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(student_id) BUCKETS AUTO
PROPERTIES (
    "replication_allocation" = "tag.location.default: 1"
);

-- Insert example data
INSERT INTO weighted_scores VALUES
(1, 85.5, 1),   -- Normal homework score, weight 1
(2, 90.0, 2),   -- Important homework score, weight 2
(3, 75.5, 1),
(4, 95.5, 3),   -- Very important homework, weight 3
(5, 88.0, 2),
(6, 92.5, 2),
(7, 78.0, 1),
(8, 89.5, 2),
(9, 94.0, 3),
(10, 83.5, 1);

-- Calculate weighted scores distribution
SELECT 
    -- Calculate 90th percentile for different compression ratios
    percentile_approx_weighted(score, weight, 0.9) as p90_default,          -- Default compression ratio
    percentile_approx_weighted(score, weight, 0.9, 2048) as p90_fast,       -- Lower compression ratio, faster
    percentile_approx_weighted(score, weight, 0.9, 10000) as p90_accurate   -- Higher compression ratio, more accurate
FROM weighted_scores;
```
