## Description

The YEAR_OF_WEEK function returns the week-year (year of week) for a specified date according to the ISO 8601 week calendar standard. Unlike regular years, ISO week-years are calculated in week units, where the first week of a year is the week containing January 4th, and that week must contain at least 4 days belonging to that year.

Unlike the [year function](./year), which simply returns the year of the input date, YEAR_OF_WEEK follows the ISO week calendar standard.

For more detailed information, please refer to [ISO Week Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

## Alias

```sql
YEAR_OF_WEEK(`<date_or_time_expr>`)
YOW(`<date_or_time_expr>`)
