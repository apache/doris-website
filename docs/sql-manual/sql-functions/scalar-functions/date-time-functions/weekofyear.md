## Description
The WEEKOFYEAR function returns the week number of a specified date within the year (range 1-53).
A week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
Within a year, if a week contains 4 or more days in the current year, that week is considered the 1st week of the current year; otherwise, that week belongs to the last week of the previous year (which may be week 52 or 53).

This function behaves consistently with the [weekofyear function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_weekofyear) in MySQL.

## Syntax

```sql
INT WEEKOFYEAR(`<date_or_time_expr>`)
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `<datetime_or_date>` | Input datetime value, supports date/datetime types. For datetime and date formats, please refer to [datetime conversion](../../../../../docs/sql-manual/basic-element/sql-data-types/conversion/datetime-conversion) and [date conversion](../../../../../docs/sql-manual/basic-element/sql-data-types/conversion/date-conversion) |

## Return Value

Returns INT type week number, range 1-53, representing which week of the year the date belongs to.

- If the week containing January 1st has fewer than 4 days in the current year (e.g., if January 1st is a Wednesday, that week only has January 1-3 in the current year, totaling 3 days), then that week belongs to the previous year, and the 1st week of the current year starts from the next Sunday.
- When the week at the end of December has fewer than 4 days total, that week belongs to the first week of the next year
- Input NULL returns NULL
