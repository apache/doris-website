## Description

The function returns the quarter (1 to 4) that the specified date belongs to. Each quarter contains three months:
- Quarter 1: January to March
- Quarter 2: April to June
- Quarter 3: July to September
- Quarter 4: October to December

This function behaves consistently with MySQL's [quarter function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_quarter).

## Syntax

```sql
QUARTER(`<date_or_time_expr>`)
```

## Parameters

For specific datetime and date formats, see [datetime conversion](../../../../../docs/sql-manual/basic-element/sql-data-types/conversion/datetime-conversion) and [date conversion](../../../../../docs/sql-manual/basic-element/sql-data-types/conversion/date-conversion). |

## Return Value

- Returns a TINYINT representing the quarter that the input date belongs to, ranging from 1 to 4.
- If the input value is NULL, the function returns NULL.
