## Description

Filters text based on given conditions.

## Syntax

```sql
AI_FILTER([<resource_name>], <text>)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter         | Description                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `<resource_name>` | The specified resource name, optional |
| `<text>`          | The information to be evaluated   |

## Return Value

Returns a boolean value.

If any input is NULL, returns NULL.

The result is generated by the large language model, so the output may not be fixed.

## Example

Suppose you have the following table representing comments received by a courier company:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_comments (
    id      INT,
    comment VARCHAR(500)
) DUPLICATE KEY(id)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES (
    "replication_num" = "1"
);
```

If you want to query the positive comments, you can use:
```sql
SELECT id, comment FROM user_comments
WHERE AI_FILTER('resource_name', CONCAT('This is a positive comment: ', comment));
```

The result may look like:
```text
+------+--------------------------------------------+
| id   | comment                                    |
+------+--------------------------------------------+
|    1 | Absolutely fantastic, highly recommend it. |
|    3 | This product is amazing and I love it.     |
+------+--------------------------------------------+
```
