[MaxCompute](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/maxcompute/) is an enterprise-level SaaS (Software as a Service) cloud data warehouse on Alibaba Cloud. Through the open storage SDK provided by MaxCompute, Doris can access MaxCompute table information and perform queries.

## Applicable Scenarios

| Scenario | Description                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Integration | Read MaxCompute data and write it to Doris internal tables. |
| Data Write-back | Not supported.                           |

## Notes

1. Starting from version 2.1.7, the MaxCompute Catalog is developed based on the [open storage SDK](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/maxcompute/user-guide/overview-1). Before this, it was developed based on the Tunnel API.

2. There are certain restrictions on the use of the open storage SDK. Please refer to the `Usage Restrictions` section in this [document](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/maxcompute/user-guide/overview-1).

3. A `Project` in MaxCompute is equivalent to a `Database` in Doris.

## Configuring Catalog

## Examples

```sql
CREATE CATALOG mc_catalog PROPERTIES (
    'type' = 'max_compute',
    'mc.default.project' = 'project',
    'mc.access_key' = 'sk',
    'mc.secret_key' = 'ak',
    'mc.endpoint' = 'http://service.cn-beijing-vpc.MaxCompute.aliyun-inc.com/api'
);
```

If you are using a version earlier than 2.1.7 (exclusive), please use the following statements. (It is recommended to upgrade to 2.1.8 or later for usage)

```sql
CREATE CATALOG mc_catalog PROPERTIES (
    'type' = 'max_compute',
    'mc.region' = 'cn-beijing',
    'mc.default.project' = 'project',
    'mc.access_key' = 'ak',
    'mc.secret_key' = 'sk'
    'mc.odps_endpoint' = 'http://service.cn-beijing.maxcompute.aliyun-inc.com/api',
    'mc.tunnel_endpoint' = 'http://dt.cn-beijing.maxcompute.aliyun-inc.com'
);
```

## Query Operations

### Basic Query

```sql
-- 1. Switch to catalog, use database, and query
SWITCH mc_ctl;
USE mc_ctl;
SELECT * FROM mc_tbl LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Use mc database directly
USE mc_ctl.mc_db;
SELECT * FROM mc_tbl LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Use fully qualified name to query
SELECT * FROM mc_ctl.mc_db.mc_tbl LIMIT 10;
```

## Appendix

### How to Obtain Endpoint and Quota (For Doris 2.1.7 and Later)

1. If using a dedicated resource group for Data Transmission Service (DTS)  

	Refer to the [documentation](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/maxcompute/user-guide/purchase-and-use-exclusive-resource-groups-for-dts) under the section **"Use Dedicated Data Service Resource Groups"**, specifically **"2. Authorization"**, to enable the required permissions. Then, navigate to the **"Quota Management"** list to view and copy the corresponding `QuotaName`, and specify it using `"mc.quota" = "QuotaName"`. At this point, you can choose to access MaxCompute via VPC or public network. However, VPC provides guaranteed bandwidth, while public network bandwidth is limited.

2. If using `pay-as-you-go`
 
   Refer to the [documentation](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/maxcompute/user-guide/overview-1) under the section **"Using Open Storage (Pay-As-You-Go)"** to enable the Open Storage (Storage API) switch and grant permissions to the user corresponding to the Ak and SK. In this case, `mc.quota` defaults to `pay-as-you-go`, and no additional value needs to be specified. When using the pay-as-you-go model, MaxCompute can only be accessed via VPC, and public network access is not available. Only prepaid users can access MaxCompute via the public network.

3. Configure `mc.endpoint` based on the [Alibaba Cloud Endpoints Documentation](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/maxcompute/user-guide/endpoints)  
   
   For users accessing via VPC, refer to the **"VPC Network Endpoint"** column in the **"Regional Endpoint Table (Alibaba Cloud VPC Network Connection Method)"** to configure `mc.endpoint`.
   
   For users accessing via the public network, you can choose from the **"Classic Network Endpoint"** column in the **"Regional Endpoint Table (Alibaba Cloud Classic Network Connection Method)"**, or the **"External Network Endpoint"** column in the **"Regional Endpoint Table (External Network Connection Method)"** to configure `mc.endpoint`.
   
### Custom Service Address (For Doris Versions before 2.1.7)

In Doris versions before 2.1.7, the **Tunnel SDK** is used to interact with MaxCompute. Therefore, the following two endpoint properties need to be configured:

- `mc.odps_endpoint`: MaxCompute Endpoint, used to retrieve MaxCompute metadata (e.g., database and table information).
- `mc.tunnel_endpoint`: Tunnel Endpoint, used to read MaxCompute data.

By default, the MaxCompute Catalog generates endpoints based on the values of `mc.region` and `mc.public_access`.

The generated endpoint formats are as follows:

| `mc.public_access`  | `mc.odps_endpoint`                                       | `mc.tunnel_endpoint`                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `false`             | `http://service.{mc.region}.maxcompute.aliyun-inc.com/api` | `http://dt.{mc.region}.maxcompute.aliyun-inc.com` |
| `true`              | `http://service.{mc.region}.maxcompute.aliyun.com/api`     | `http://dt.{mc.region}.maxcompute.aliyun.com`     |

Users can also manually specify `mc.odps_endpoint` and `mc.tunnel_endpoint` to customize the service addresses. This is particularly useful for private deployments of MaxCompute environments.

For details on configuring MaxCompute Endpoint and Tunnel Endpoint, refer to the documentation on [Endpoints for Different Regions and Network Connection Methods](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/maxcompute/user-guide/endpoints).
