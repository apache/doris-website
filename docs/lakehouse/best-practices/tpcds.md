Doris supports using the [TPCDS Connector](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/tpcds.html) to quickly build TPCDS test sets through the [Trino Connector](https://doris.apache.org/community/how-to-contribute/trino-connector-developer-guide) compatible framework.

Combined with the data write-back function of Hive/Iceberg tables, you can quickly build TPCDS test data sets for Doris, Hive, and Iceberg tables through Doris.

This document mainly introduces how to deploy and use the TPCDS Connector to build test data sets.

:::tip
This feature is supported starting from Doris version 3.0.0.
:::

## Compile TPCDS Connector

> Requires JDK version 17.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trinodb/trino.git
git checkout 435
cd trino/plugin/trino-tpcds
mvn clean install -DskipTest
```

After compilation, you will get the `trino-tpcds-435/` directory under `trino/plugin/trino-tpcds/target/`.

You can also directly download the precompiled [trino-tpcds-435.tar.gz](https://github.com/morningman/trino-connectors/releases/download/trino-connectors/trino-tpcds-435.tar.gz) and extract it.

## Deploy TPCDS Connector

Place the `trino-tpcds-435/` directory under the `connectors/` directory of all FE and BE deployment paths. (If not present, you can create it manually).

```text
├── bin
├── conf
├── connectors
│   ├── trino-tpcds-435
...
```

After deployment, it is recommended to restart the FE and BE nodes to ensure the Connector can be loaded correctly.

## Create TPCDS Catalog

```sql
CREATE CATALOG `tpcds` PROPERTIES (
    "type" = "trino-connector",
    "trino.connector.name" = "tpcds",
    "trino.tpcds.split-count" = "32"
);
```

The `tpcds.split-count` is the concurrency number, which is recommended to be set to 2 times the number of cores per BE machine to achieve optimal concurrency. Improve data generation efficiency.

## Use TPCDS Catalog

The TPCDS Catalog has pre-built TPCDS datasets of different Scale Factors, which can be viewed using the `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW TABLES` commands.

```sql
mysql> SWITCH tpcds;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+

| web_returns            |
| web_sales              |
| web_site               |
+------------------------+
```

You can directly query these tables using the SELECT statement.

:::tip
The data of these pre-built datasets is not actually stored but is generated in real-time during queries. Therefore, these pre-built datasets are not suitable for direct Benchmark testing. They are suitable for writing datasets into other target tables (such as Doris internal tables, Hive, Iceberg, and other data sources that Doris supports writing to) through `INSERT INTO SELECT`, and then performing performance testing on the target tables.

## Build TPCDS Test Data Set

The following example quickly builds a TPCDS test data set on Hive using the CTAS statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.call_center            PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.call_center           ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.catalog_page           PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.catalog_page          ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.catalog_returns        PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.catalog_returns       ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.catalog_sales          PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.catalog_sales         ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.customer               PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.customer              ;

CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.reason                 PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.reason                ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.ship_mode              PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.ship_mode             ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.store                  PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.store                 ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.store_returns          PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.store_returns         ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.store_sales            PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.store_sales           ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.time_dim               PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.time_dim              ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.warehouse              PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.warehouse             ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.web_page               PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.web_page              ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.web_returns            PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.web_returns           ;
CREATE TABLE hive.tpcds100.web_sales              PROPERTIES("file_format" = "parquet") AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.sf100.web_sales             ;

```

:::tip
In a Doris cluster with 3 16C BE nodes, creating a TPCDS 1000 Hive dataset takes about 3 to 4 hours.
