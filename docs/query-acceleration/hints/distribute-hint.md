## Overview

The Distribute hint is used to control the shuffle method for joins.

## Syntax

- Supports specifying the Distribute Type for the right table, which can be either `[shuffle]` or `[broadcast]`, and should be written before the right table in the Join.
- Supports an arbitrary number of Distribute Hints.
- When encountering a Distribute Hint that cannot correctly generate a plan, the system will not display an error. It will make the best effort to apply the hint, and the final Distribute method will be shown in the EXPLAIN output.

## Examples

**Used in Combination with Ordered Hint**

Fix the Join order to the textual sequence, and then specify the expected Distribute method for the Join. For example:  

Before using:  

```sql
mysql> explain shape plan select count(*) from t1 join t2 on t1.c1 = t2.c2;

```

The Explain Shape Plan will display information related to the Distribute operator. Specifically:

- `DistributionSpecReplicated` indicates that the corresponding data will be replicated to all BE nodes.
- `DistributionSpecGather` indicates that the data will be gathered to the FE node.
- `DistributionSpecHash` indicates that the data will be distributed to different BE nodes based on a specific hashKey and algorithm.
**Used in Combination with Leading Hint**

When writing SQL queries, you can specify the corresponding `DISTRIBUTE` method for each `JOIN` operation while using the `LEADING` hint. Below is a specific example demonstrating how to mix `Distribute Hint` and `Leading Hint` in an SQL query.

```sql
explain shape plan
    select 
        nation,
        o_year,
        sum(amount) as sum_profit
    from
        (
            select
                /*+ leading(orders shuffle {lineitem shuffle part} shuffle {supplier broadcast nation} shuffle partsupp) */
                n_name as nation,
                extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
                l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount
            from
                part,
                supplier,
                lineitem,
                partsupp,
                orders,
                nation
            where
                s_suppkey = l_suppkey
                and ps_suppkey = l_suppkey
                and ps_partkey = l_partkey
                and p_partkey = l_partkey
                and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
                and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
                and p_name like '%green%'
        ) as profit
    group by
        nation,
        o_year
    order by
        nation,
        o_year desc;
```

## Summary

The Distribute hint is a commonly used hint for controlling the join shuffle method, allowing manual specification of shuffle or broadcast distribution methods. Proper use of the Distribute hint can meet on-site tuning needs for join shuffle methods, increasing the flexibility of system control.
