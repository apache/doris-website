## Overview

The query optimizer applies a series of rules when generating execution plans. These rules are mainly categorized into two types: Rule-Based Optimizer (RBO) and Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO).

- RBO: This type of optimization improves query plans by applying a set of predefined heuristic rules without considering specific data statistics. Strategies such as predicate pushdown and projection pushdown fall into this category.
- CBO: This type of optimization leverages data statistics to estimate the cost of different execution plans and selects the plan with the lowest cost for execution. This includes choices of access paths and join algorithms.

In some cases, database administrators or developers may need more granular control over the query optimization process. Based on this, this document will introduce how to use query hints to manage CBO rules.

The basic syntax for CBO rule control hints is as follows:

```sql
SELECT /*+ USE_CBO_RULE(rule1, rule2, ...) */ ...
```

This hint immediately follows the `SELECT` keyword and specifies the names of the rules to be enabled within parentheses (rule names are case-insensitive).

Currently, the Doris optimizer supports several cost-based rewrites, which can be explicitly enabled using the `USE_CBO_RULE` hint, such as:

- PUSH_DOWN_AGG_THROUGH_JOIN
- PUSH_DOWN_AGG_THROUGH_JOIN_ONE_SIDE
- PUSH_DOWN_DISTINCT_THROUGH_JOIN

## Example

Here is a query example:

```sql
explain shape plan
    select /*+ USE_CBO_RULE(push_down_agg_through_join_one_side) */
            a.event_id,
            b.group_id,
            COUNT(a.event_id)
    from a
    join b on
            a.device_id = b.device_id
    group by
            a.event_id,
            b.group_id
    ;
```

In this example, a CBO rule for aggregation pushdown is enabled. This operation allows table a to be aggregated before the join operation, reducing the cost of the join and speeding up the query. The plan after pushdown is as follows:

```sql
PhysicalResultSink
--hashAgg[GLOBAL]
----hashAgg[LOCAL]
------hashJoin[INNER_JOIN] hashCondition=((a.device_id = b.device_id)) otherCondition=()
--------hashAgg[LOCAL]
----------PhysicalOlapScan[a]
--------filter((cast(experiment_id as DOUBLE) = 73.0))
----------PhysicalOlapScan[b]
```

## Summary

Proper use of the `USE_CBO_RULE` hint can help manually enable certain advanced CBO optimization rules, optimizing performance in specific scenarios. However, using CBO optimization rules requires a deep understanding of the query optimization process and data characteristics. In most cases, relying on the automatic decisions of the Doris optimizer is still the best choice.
