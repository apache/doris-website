# Compile on Windows 

This guide is about how to compile Doris source code on the Windows platform using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows you to run a Linux system on Windows to compile Doris.

## Prerequisites

1. Windows 10 version 2004 or higher (19041 or higher) or Windows 11

## Compilation steps

### Install WSL2

Refer to the official Microsoft [WSL installation documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for detailed instructions.

### Compile Doris

Once you have WSL2 up and running, you can choose any of the available compilation methods for Doris on Linux:

- [Compile with LDB Toolchain (Recommended)](https://selectdb.feishu.cn/wiki/IjA4w6tXZibnAXkyWTqcVzScn7b)
- [Docker Deployment (Recommended)](https://selectdb.feishu.cn/wiki/P2riwmN8hiqcfukBt1Pc4AKXnXc)

## Note

By default, the data storage drive of WSL2 distribution is the C drive. If needed, you can switch the storage drive in advance to avoid filling up the system drive.
