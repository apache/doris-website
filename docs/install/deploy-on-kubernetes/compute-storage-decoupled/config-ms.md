MS is the abbreviation of MetaService, the storage and computing separation component of Doris, which provides metadata management and query services. The configuration field in `DorisDisaggregatedClulster` is metaService.

## Simplest configuration

MS service is a stateless service and is usually deployed in active-standby mode. The simplest configuration is as follows:

```yaml
spec:
  metaService:
    image: {msImage}
    fdb:
      configMapNamespaceName:
        name: {foundationdbConfigmap}
        namespace: {namespace}
```

Among them, `{msImage}` is the version of the MS service you want to deploy.
`{foundationdbConfigmap}` is the access configmap provided by the FDB service deployed by K8s.
`{namespace}` ä¸º is the Namespace where the FDB service deployed in K8s is located.

## Configure resources

Add resource usage restrictions for the MS service. Take the 4c 4Gi configuration as an example:

```yaml
spec:
  metaService:
    image: {msImage}
    replicas: 2
    requests:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 4Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 4Gi
```

Update the modified configuration to the [metadata management resources for storage and computing separation that need to be deployed](install-quickstart.md#step-2-quickly-deploy-a-storage-and-computing-separation-cluster).

## Configure FDB
- Use ConfigMap  
  The FDB cluster is built on the same K8s cluster and can obtain its namespace and configmap. Use the following configuration:
```yaml
spec:
  metaService:
    image: {msImage}
    fdb:
      configMapNamespaceName:
        name: {foundationdbConfigmap}
        namespace: {namespace}
```
- Directly Endpoint
  The FDB is deployed on a physical machine, Please configure the FDB endpoint (FDB access string) for the metaService. The configuration is as follows:

```yaml
spec:
  metaService:
    image: {msImage}
    fdb:
      address: {fdb_endpoint}
```

## Customized configuration file

ConfigMap is used to mount the configuration file on K8s. Doris-Operator automates add the configuration of mutual perception between storage and computing separation components. When deploying MS services using customized configuration files, please do not configure FDB related configuration.

Use ConfigMap to mount the configuration file to deploy MS services:

**ConfigMap**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  doris_cloud.conf: |
    # // meta_service
    brpc_listen_port = 5000
    brpc_num_threads = -1
    brpc_idle_timeout_sec = 30
    http_token = greedisgood9999

    # // doris txn config
    label_keep_max_second = 259200
    expired_txn_scan_key_nums = 1000

    # // logging
    log_dir = ./log/
    # info warn error
    log_level = info
    log_size_mb = 1024
    log_filenum_quota = 10
    log_immediate_flush = false
    # log_verbose_modules = *

    # //max stage num
    max_num_stages = 40
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: doris-metaservice
  namespace: default
```

The MS configuration using the above ConfigMap is as follows:

```yaml
spec:
  metaService:
    image: {msImage}
    configMaps:
      - name: doris-metaservice
        mountPath: /etc/doris
```

In actual deployment, configure the name and namespace of ConfigMap as needed, and configure the configuration information in the [storage-and-computing-separation metadata management resource](install-quickstart#step-2-quickly-deploy-a-storage-and-computing-separation-cluster) to be deployed according to the above sample format. The startup configuration file used by the MS service is named `doris_cloud.conf`, so the key of the ConfigMap for mounting the startup configuration must also be `doris_cloud.conf`. The startup configuration must be mounted to the `/etc/doris` directory, that is, the mountPath is `/etc/doris`.

:::tip Tip
MS services need to use FDB as the backend metadata storage. FDB services must be deployed when deploying MS services.
