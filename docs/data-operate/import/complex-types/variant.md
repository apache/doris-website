The VARIANT type can store semi-structured JSON data, allowing for the storage of complex data structures that contain different data types (such as integers, strings, booleans, etc.) without the need to predefine specific columns in the table structure. This type is particularly suitable for handling complex nested structures that may change at any time. During the writing process, the VARIANT type can automatically infer the structure and type of the columns, dynamically merging the written schema, and storing the JSON keys and their corresponding values as columns and dynamic sub-columns. For more documentation, please refer to [VARIANT](../../../sql-manual/sql-data-types/semi-structured/VARIANT.md).

## Usage Limitations

Supports CSV and JSON formats.

## Loading CSV Format

### Step 1: Prepare Data

Create a CSV file named `test_variant.csv` with the following content:

```SQL
14186154924|PushEvent|{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/282080?","display_login":"brianchandotcom","gravatar_id":"","id":282080,"login":"brianchandotcom","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianchandotcom"}|{"id":1920851,"name":"brianchandotcom/liferay-portal","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brianchandotcom/liferay-portal"}|{"before":"abb58cc0db673a0bd5190000d2ff9c53bb51d04d","commits":[""],"distinct_size":4,"head":"91edd3c8c98c214155191feb852831ec535580ba","push_id":6027092734,"ref":"refs/heads/master","size":4}|1|2020-11-14 02:00:00
```

### Step 2: Create Table in Database

Execute the following SQL statement to create the table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS testdb.test_variant (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(30) NULL,
    actor VARIANT NULL,
    repo VARIANT NULL,
    payload VARIANT NULL,
    public BOOLEAN NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NULL,
    INDEX idx_payload (`payload`) USING INVERTED PROPERTIES("parser" = "english") COMMENT 'inverted index for payload'
)
DUPLICATE KEY(`id`)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id) BUCKETS 10
properties("replication_num" = "1");
```

### Step 3: Load Data

Using stream load as an example, use the following command to load data:

```SQL
curl --location-trusted -u root:  -T test_variant.csv -H "column_separator:|" http://127.0.0.1:8030/api/testdb/test_variant/_stream_load
```

Example of load results:

```SQL
{
    "TxnId": 12,
    "Label": "96cd6250-9c78-4a9f-b8b3-2b7cef0dd606",
    "Comment": "",
    "TwoPhaseCommit": "false",
    "Status": "Success",
    "Message": "OK",
    "NumberTotalRows": 1,
    "NumberLoadedRows": 1,
    "NumberFilteredRows": 0,
    "NumberUnselectedRows": 0,
    "LoadBytes": 660,
    "LoadTimeMs": 213,
    "BeginTxnTimeMs": 0,
    "StreamLoadPutTimeMs": 6,
    "ReadDataTimeMs": 0,
    "WriteDataTimeMs": 183,
    "ReceiveDataTimeMs": 14,
    "CommitAndPublishTimeMs": 20
}
```

### Step 4: Check Loaded Data

Use the following SQL query to check the loaded data:

```SQL
mysql> select * from testdb.test_variant\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
        id: 14186154924
      type: PushEvent
     actor: {"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/282080?","display_login":"brianchandotcom","gravatar_id":"","id":282080,"login":"brianchandotcom","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianchandotcom"}
      repo: {"id":1920851,"name":"brianchandotcom/liferay-portal","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brianchandotcom/liferay-portal"}
   payload: {"before":"abb58cc0db673a0bd5190000d2ff9c53bb51d04d","commits":[""],"distinct_size":4,"head":"91edd3c8c98c214155191feb852831ec535580ba","push_id":6027092734,"ref":"refs/heads/master","size":4}
    public: 1
created_at: 2020-11-14 02:00:00
```

## Loading JSON Format

### Step 1: Prepare Data

Create a JSON file named `test_variant.json` with the following content:

```SQL
{"id": "14186154924","type": "PushEvent","actor": {"id": 282080,"login":"brianchandotcom","display_login": "brianchandotcom","gravatar_id": "","url": "https://api.github.com/users/brianchandotcom","avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/282080?"},"repo": {"id": 1920851,"name": "brianchandotcom/liferay-portal","url": "https://api.github.com/repos/brianchandotcom/liferay-portal"},"payload": {"push_id": 6027092734,"size": 4,"distinct_size": 4,"ref": "refs/heads/master","head": "91edd3c8c98c214155191feb852831ec535580ba","before": "abb58cc0db673a0bd5190000d2ff9c53bb51d04d","commits": [""]},"public": true,"created_at": "2020-11-13T18:00:00Z"}
```

### Step 2: Create Table in Database

Execute the following SQL statement to create the table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS testdb.test_variant (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(30) NULL,
    actor VARIANT NULL,
    repo VARIANT NULL,
    payload VARIANT NULL,
    public BOOLEAN NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NULL,
    INDEX idx_payload (`payload`) USING INVERTED PROPERTIES("parser" = "english") COMMENT 'inverted index for payload'
)
DUPLICATE KEY(`id`)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id) BUCKETS 10;
```

### Step 3: Load Data

Using stream load as an example, use the following command to load data:

```SQL
curl --location-trusted -u root:  -T test_variant.json -H "format:json"  http://127.0.0.1:8030/api/testdb/test_variant/_stream_load
```

Example of load results:

```SQL
{
    "TxnId": 12,
    "Label": "96cd6250-9c78-4a9f-b8b3-2b7cef0dd606",
    "Comment": "",
    "TwoPhaseCommit": "false",
    "Status": "Success",
    "Message": "OK",
    "NumberTotalRows": 1,
    "NumberLoadedRows": 1,
    "NumberFilteredRows": 0,
    "NumberUnselectedRows": 0,
    "LoadBytes": 660,
    "LoadTimeMs": 213,
    "BeginTxnTimeMs": 0,
    "StreamLoadPutTimeMs": 6,
    "ReadDataTimeMs": 0,
    "WriteDataTimeMs": 183,
    "ReceiveDataTimeMs": 14,
    "CommitAndPublishTimeMs": 20
}
```

### Step 4: Check Loaded Data

Use the following SQL query to check the loaded data:

```SQL
