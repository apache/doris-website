## Power BI Introduction

Power BI is a collection of software services and application connectors that can connect to multiple data sources, including Excel, SQL Server, Azure, Google Analytics, etc., so that users can easily consolidate and clean their data. With Power BI's data modeling, users can create relational models, data analysis expressions, and data relationships to support advanced data analysis and visualization. Power BI offers a wealth of visualization options, including ICONS, maps, dashboards, and custom visualization tools to help users make a more intuitive sense of data.

The Apache Doris community provides a Power BI DirectQuery custom connector based on MySQL ODBC, which supports Apache Doris's internal data modeling, data query, and visualization processing.

## Precondition

- If you don't have Power BI Desktop installed, you can visit [here](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/power-platform/products/power-bi/desktop) to download and install Power BI.
- You need to obtain the [power-bi-doris](https://github.com/velodb/power-bi-doris/blob/master/Doris.mez) custom connector.
- If you don't have Mysql ODBC installed, you need to download and install [Mysql ODBC](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-odbc/) and configure it.

:::info Note
Use MySQL ODBC Driver 5.3

## Set  data refresh automatic

1. Download the On-premises data gateway. Download address: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-personal-mode
2. Install the On-premises data gateway

   ![gateway install](/images/powerbi/bi-powerbi-en-9.png)

3. Log into Power BI Online and import the local model in your workspace

   ![upload](/images/powerbi/bi-powerbi-en-10-zh.png)

4. Click the model to set the automatic refresh time

   ![click module](/images/powerbi/bi-powerbi-en-11.png)

5. The data refresh configuration requires a gataway connection. After the gateway is enabled locally, you can see the  started gateway in the gateway connection locally. Select the local gateway. 

   ![config gateway](/images/powerbi/bi-powerbi-en-12.png)

6. Configure the refresh schedule to complete the automatic data refresh on Power BI
