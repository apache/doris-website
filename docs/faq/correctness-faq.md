# Data Integrity Issues

This document is mainly used to record common data integrity issues encountered during the use of Doris. It will be updated periodically.

The term "duplicate key data in the table" refers to the appearance of duplicate key data in the merge-on-write Unique table. Duplicate key issues in merge-on-write Unique tables can be fixed by [triggering a full compaction](../admin-manual/trouble-shooting/repairing-data), while other types of integrity issues may require specific solutions based on the situation. For assistance, please contact community support.

| Issue Description | Occurrence Conditions | Affected Versions | Fix Versions | Impacted Scope | Fix PR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
